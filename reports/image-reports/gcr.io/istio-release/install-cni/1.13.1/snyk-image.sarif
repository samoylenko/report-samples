By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support &#34;saved UID&#34; functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use &#34;enable -f&#34; for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `bash` to version 5.0-6ubuntu1.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18276](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18276)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200430-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200430-0003/)\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18276](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18276)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-34](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-34)\n- [https://github.com/bminor/bash/commit/951bdaad7a18cc0dc1036bba86b18b90874d39ff](https://github.com/bminor/bash/commit/951bdaad7a18cc0dc1036bba86b18b90874d39ff)\n- [http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155498/Bash-5.0-Patch-11-Privilege-Escalation.html](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155498/Bash-5.0-Patch-11-Privilege-Escalation.html)\n- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8)\n- [https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772@%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772@%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E)\n- [https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772%40%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772%40%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html)\n- [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47726](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47726)\n"

And if using the correct file format of course.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `curl` to version 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.20 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-38546](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-38546)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/34](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/34)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/37](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/37)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/38](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/38)\n- [https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38546.html](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38546.html)\n- [https://forum.vmssoftware.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=8868](https://forum.vmssoftware.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=8868)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OGMXNRNSJ4ETDK6FRNU3J7SABXPWCHSQ/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OGMXNRNSJ4ETDK6FRNU3J7SABXPWCHSQ/)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214036](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214036)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214057](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214057)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214058](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214058)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214063](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214063)\n"

This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `gcc-10` to version 10.5.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1+esm1 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-4039](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-4039)\n- [https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/GCC%20Stack%20Protector%20Vulnerability%20AArch64](https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/GCC%20Stack%20Protector%20Vulnerability%20AArch64)\n- [https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf](https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf)\n"

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH&#39;s use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `libssh` to version 0.9.3-2ubuntu2.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-6918](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-6918)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LZQVUHWVWRH73YBXUQJOD6CKHDQBU3DM/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LZQVUHWVWRH73YBXUQJOD6CKHDQBU3DM/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MKQRBF3DWMWPH36LBCOBUTSIZRTPEZXB/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MKQRBF3DWMWPH36LBCOBUTSIZRTPEZXB/)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2504](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2504)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3233](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3233)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6918](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6918)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254997](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254997)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250214-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250214-0009/)\n- [https://www.libssh.org/2023/12/18/libssh-0-10-6-and-libssh-0-9-8-security-releases/](https://www.libssh.org/2023/12/18/libssh-0-10-6-and-libssh-0-9-8-security-releases/)\n- [https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-6918.txt](https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-6918.txt)\n"

Inn versions up to and including 2.10, the Linux network utilities (like ifconfig) from the net-tools package do not properly validate the structure of /proc files when showing interfaces. `get_name()` in `interface.c` copies interface labels from `/proc/net/dev` into a fixed 16-byte stack buffer without bounds checking, leading to possible arbitrary code execution or crash. The known attack path does not require privilege but also does not provide privilege escalation in this scenario. A patch is available and expected to be part of version 2.20.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `net-tools` to version 1.60+git20180626.aebd88e-1ubuntu1.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2025-46836](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2025-46836)\n- [https://github.com/ecki/net-tools/commit/7a8f42fb20013a1493d8cae1c43436f85e656f2d](https://github.com/ecki/net-tools/commit/7a8f42fb20013a1493d8cae1c43436f85e656f2d)\n- [https://github.com/ecki/net-tools/security/advisories/GHSA-pfwf-h6m3-63wf](https://github.com/ecki/net-tools/security/advisories/GHSA-pfwf-h6m3-63wf)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00053.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00053.html)\n"

The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability.

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `openssl` to version 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.12 or higher.\n## References\n-

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure.

This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `openssl` to version 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.17 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-0215](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-0215)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8818064ce3c3c0f1b740a5aaba2a987e75bfbafd](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8818064ce3c3c0f1b740a5aaba2a987e75bfbafd)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9816136fe31d92ace4037d5da5257f763aeeb4eb](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9816136fe31d92ace4037d5da5257f763aeeb4eb)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c3829dd8825c654652201e16f8a0a0c46ee3f344](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c3829dd8825c654652201e16f8a0a0c46ee3f344)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0009/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt)\n"

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but\nthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type\nof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by\nthe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an\nASN1_STRING.\n\nWhen CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the\nX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass\narbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or\nenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\nvalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other\ninput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which\nis uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect\napplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs\nover a network.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `openssl` to version 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.17 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-0286](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-0286)\n- [https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-3.6.2-relnotes.txt](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-3.6.2-relnotes.txt)\n- [https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.2/common/018_x509.patch.sig](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.2/common/018_x509.patch.sig)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2c6c9d439b484e1ba9830d8454a34fa4f80fdfe9](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2c6c9d439b484e1ba9830d8454a34fa4f80fdfe9)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2f7530077e0ef79d98718138716bc51ca0cad658](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2f7530077e0ef79d98718138716bc51ca0cad658)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fd2af07dc083a350c959147097003a14a5e8ac4d](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fd2af07dc083a350c959147097003a14a5e8ac4d)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt)\n"

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with &#39;n&#39; being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer&#39;s certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `openssl` to version 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.19 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2650](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2650)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html)\n- [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt)\n"

The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n&#34;-pubcheck&#34; option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `openssl` to version 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.21 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-5678](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-5678)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/2)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0010/)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt)\n"

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a &#34;no overlap&#34;\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `openssl` to version 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.23 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-5535](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-5535)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt)\n"

This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original&#39;s privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.\n\nA SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner&#39;s permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original&#39;s SUID process coredump file.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file&#39;s name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of &#34;Member name contains &#39;..&#39;&#34; that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain &#34;x -&gt; ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh&#34; and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which &#34;tar xf&#34; is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each &#34;tar xf&#34; in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run &#34;tar xf&#34; more than once into the same directory.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Ubuntu:20.04` `tar`.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2025-45582](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2025-45582)\n- [https://github.com/i900008/vulndb/blob/main/Gnu_tar_vuln.md](https://github.com/i900008/vulndb/blob/main/Gnu_tar_vuln.md)\n- [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)\n- [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2025-08/msg00012.html](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2025-08/msg00012.html)\n- [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Integrity.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Integrity.html)\n- [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Security-rules-of-thumb.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Security-rules-of-thumb.html)\n"

NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `zlib` to version 1:1.2.11.dfsg-2ubuntu1.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-37434](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-37434)\n-

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2` to version 0.7.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/97fe3a23b68dd2df748f2369827aeab2420e0930)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8e2b117aee74f6b86c207a808b0255de45c0a18a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57855)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E)\n"

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack` to version 0.7.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/97fe3a23b68dd2df748f2369827aeab2420e0930)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8e2b117aee74f6b86c207a808b0255de45c0a18a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57855)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E)\n"

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack` to version 0.7.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/97fe3a23b68dd2df748f2369827aeab2420e0930)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8e2b117aee74f6b86c207a808b0255de45c0a18a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57855)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E)\n"
