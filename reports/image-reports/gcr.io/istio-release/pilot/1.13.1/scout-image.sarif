However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by applications.  The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.  The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.  The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.

However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by applications.  The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.  The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.  The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.  While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.\n",

Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for `x*`, which would match even though the IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an `x`.\n\n|                |                                                                                       |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/curl@7.68.0-1ubuntu2.7?os_distro=focal&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=20.04 |\n| Affected range | <7.68.0-1ubuntu2.19                                                                   |\n| Fixed version  | 7.68.0-1ubuntu2.19                                                                    |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                   5.9 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N                                          |\n"

However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.\n\n|                |                                                                                    |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/bash@5.0-6ubuntu1.1?os_distro=focal&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=20.04 |\n| Affected range | <5.0-6ubuntu1.2                                                                    |\n| Fixed version  | 5.0-6ubuntu1.2                                                                     |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                7.8 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H                                       |\n"

Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set.  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.\n\nThis bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14.  Users should update to this version as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.\n\nThis fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.  Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work.  Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container's bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container's bounding set per the rules described in the manual page.  In all cases the container's bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe Moby project would like to thank [Andrew G.

Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.\n\nThis bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14.  Users should update to this version as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.\n\nThis fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.  Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work.  Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container's bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container's bounding set per the rules described in the manual page.  In all cases the container's bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe Moby project would like to thank [Andrew G.

In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration.\n\nThis vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces.\n\nPrior to 9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554, in practice it was fairly difficult to specify an arbitrary-length netlink message with most container runtimes. The only user-controlled byte array was the namespace paths attributes which can be specified in runc's `config.json`, but as far as we can tell no container runtime gives raw access to that configuration setting -- and having raw access to that setting **would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely anyway** (setting them to `/proc/1/ns/...` for instance). In addition, each namespace path is limited to 4096 bytes (with only 7 namespaces supported by runc at the moment) meaning that even with custom namespace paths it appears an attacker still cannot shove enough bytes into the netlink bytemsg in order to overflow the uint16 counter.\n\nHowever, out of an abundance of caution (given how old this bug is) we decided to treat it as a potentially exploitable vulnerability with a low severity. After 9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554 (which was not present in any release of runc prior to the discovery of this bug), all mount paths are included as a giant netlink message which means that this bug becomes significantly more exploitable in more reasonable threat scenarios.\n\nThe main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure), though as mentioned above it appears this bug was not practically exploitable on any released version of runc to date.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch for this is d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae and runc 1.0.3 was released with this bug fixed.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo the extent this is exploitable, disallowing untrusted namespace paths in container configuration should eliminate all practical ways of exploiting this bug. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n### References\n* commit d72d057ba794 (\"runc init: avoid netlink message length overflows\")\n* https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero for discovering and reporting this vulnerability. In particular, the fact they found this vulnerability so quickly, before we made a 1.1 release of runc (which would've been vulnerable) was quite impressive.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our repo](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)\n\n",

After 9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554 (which was not present in any release of runc prior to the discovery of this bug), all mount paths are included as a giant netlink message which means that this bug becomes significantly more exploitable in more reasonable threat scenarios.\n\nThe main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure), though as mentioned above it appears this bug was not practically exploitable on any released version of runc to date.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch for this is d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae and runc 1.0.3 was released with this bug fixed.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo the extent this is exploitable, disallowing untrusted namespace paths in container configuration should eliminate all practical ways of exploiting this bug. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n### References\n* commit d72d057ba794 (\"runc init: avoid netlink message length overflows\")\n* https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero for discovering and reporting this vulnerability. In particular, the fact they found this vulnerability so quickly, before we made a 1.1 release of runc (which would've been vulnerable) was quite impressive.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our repo](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)\n\n\n|                |                                                 |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@1.0.2 |\n| Affected range | <1.0.3                                          |\n| Fixed version  | 1.0.3                                           |\n| CVSS Score     |                                             6.0 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L    |\n"

Therefore any error between them calls `goto error` returning SSH_OK.\n\n|                |                                                                                        |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/libssh@0.9.3-2ubuntu2.2?os_distro=focal&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=20.04 |\n| Affected range | <0.9.3-2ubuntu2.3                                                                      |\n| Fixed version  | 0.9.3-2ubuntu2.3                                                                       |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                    6.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N                                           |\n"

An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.

It needs to be valid so that the recipient can use to successfully decompress the payload. Furthermore in context JWT processing in the v2 versions, the recipient must explicitly allow JWE handling .\n\nThe attacker then crafts a message with high compression ratio, e.g. a payload with very high frequency of repeating patterns that can decompress to a much larger size.  If the payload is large enough, recipient who is decompressing the data will have to allocate a large amount of memory, which then can lead to a denial of service.\n\nThe original report includes a reference to [1], but there are some very subtle differences between this library and the aforementioned issue. The most important aspect is that the referenced issue focuses on JWT processing, whereas this library is intentionally divided into parts that comprise JOSE, i.e. JWT, JWS, JWE, JWK.

By recovering the secret from the ClientKeyExchange message, the attacker would be able to decrypt the application data exchanged over that connection.\n\n|                |                                                                                           |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/gnutls28@3.6.13-2ubuntu1.6?os_distro=focal&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=20.04 |\n| Affected range | <3.6.13-2ubuntu1.8                                                                        |\n| Fixed version  | 3.6.13-2ubuntu1.8                                                                         |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                       7.4 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N                                              |\n"

There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n|                |                                                                                              |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/heimdal@7.7.0%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu1?os_distro=focal&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=20.04 |\n| Affected range | <7.7.0+dfsg-1ubuntu1.2                                                                       |\n| Fixed version  | 7.7.0+dfsg-1ubuntu1.2                                                                        |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                          7.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H                                                 |\n"

                "text": "### Impact ###  \nThe OCI runtime specification has a `maskedPaths` feature that allows for files or directories to be \"masked\" by placing a mount on top of them to conceal their contents. This is primarily intended to protect against privileged users in non-user-namespaced from being able to write to files or access directories that would either provide sensitive information about the host to containers or allow containers to perform destructive or other privileged operations on the host (examples include `/proc/kcore`, `/proc/timer_list`, `/proc/acpi`, and `/proc/keys`).  \n\n`maskedPaths` can be used to either mask a directory or a file -- directories are masked using a new read-only `tmpfs` instance that is mounted on top of the masked path, while files are masked by bind-mounting the container's `/dev/null` on top of the masked path.  \n\nIn all known versions of runc, when using the container's `/dev/null` to mask files, runc would not perform sufficient verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container's `/dev/null`) was actually a real `/dev/null` inode. While `/dev/null` is usually created by runc when doing container creation, it is possible for an attacker to create a `/dev/null` or modify the `/dev/null` inode created by runc through race conditions with other containers sharing mounts (runc has also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with `docker buildx build` as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured).  \n\nThis could lead to two separate issues:  \n\n#### Attack 1: Arbitrary Mount Gadget (leading to Host Information Disclosure, Host Denial of Service, or Container Escape) ####  \nBy replacing `/dev/null` with a symlink to an attacker-controlled path, an attacker could cause runc to bind-mount an arbitrary source path to a path inside the container. This could lead to:  \n* **Host Denial of Service**: By bind-mounting files such as `/proc/sysrq-trigger`, the attacker can gain access to a read-write version of files which can be destructive to write to (`/proc/sysrq-trigger` would allow an attacker to trigger a kernel panic, shutting down the machine, or causing the machine to freeze without rebooting).  \n* **Container Escape**: By bind-mounting `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`, the attacker can reconfigure a coredump helper -- as kernel upcalls are not namespaced, the configured binary (which could be a container binary or a host binary with a malicious command-line) will run with full privileges on the host system. Thus, the attacker can simply trigger a coredump and gain complete root privileges over the host.  \n\nNote that while `config.json` allows users to bind-mount arbitrary paths (and thus an attacker that can modify `config.json` arbitrarily could gain the same access as this exploit), because `maskedPaths` is applied by almost all higher-level container runtimes (and thus provides a guaranteed mount source) this flaw effectively allows any attacker that can spawn containers (with some degree of control over what kinds of containers are being spawned) to achieve the above goals. \n\n#### Attack 2: Bypassing `maskedPaths` ####  \nWhile investigating Attack 1, runc discovered that the runc validation mechanism when bind-mounting `/dev/null` for `maskedPaths` would ignore `ENOENT` errors -- meaning that if an attacker deleted `/dev/null` before runc did the bind-mount, runc would silently skip applying `maskedPaths` for the container. (The original purpose of this `ENOENT`-ignore behaviour was to permit configurations where `maskedPaths` references non-existent files, but runc did not consider that the source path could also not exist in this kind of race-attack scenario.)  \n\nWith `maskedPaths` rendered inoperative, an attacker would be able to access sensitive host information from files in `/proc` that would usually be masked (such as `/proc/kcore`). However, note that `/proc/sys` and `/proc/sysrq-trigger` are mounted read-only rather than being masked with files, so this attack variant will not allow the same breakout or host denial of service attacks as in Attack 1. \n\n### Patches ###  \nThis advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:  \n* CVE-2025-31133\n* CVE-2025-52881\n* CVE-2025-52565\n\nThe patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset. The following patches from that patchset resolve the issues in this advisory:  \n* db19bbed5348 (\"internal/sys: add VerifyInode helper\")  \n* 8476df83b534 (\"libct: add/use isDevNull, verifyDevNull\")  \n* 1a30a8f3d921 (\"libct: maskPaths: only ignore ENOENT on mount dest\")  \n* 5d7b24240724 (\"libct: maskPaths: don't rely on ENOTDIR for mount\")  \n\nrunc 1.2.8, 1.3.3, and 1.4.0-rc.3 have been released and all contain fixes for these issues. As per [runc's new release model](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md), runc 1.1.x and earlier are no longer supported and thus have not been patched.  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md  \n\n### Mitigations ###  \n- Use containers with user namespaces (with the host root user not mapped into the container's user namespace). This will block most of the most serious aspects of these attacks, as the `procfs` files used for the container breakout use Unix DAC permissions and user namespaced users will not have access to the relevant files.\n\n  runc would also like to take this opportunity to re-iterate that runc **strongly** recommend all users use user namespaced containers. They have proven to be one of the best security hardening mechanisms against container breakouts, and the kernel applies additional restrictions to user namespaced containers above and beyond the user remapping functionality provided. With the advent of id-mapped mounts (Linux 5.12), there is very little reason to not use user namespaces for most applications. Note that using user namespaces to configure your container does not mean you have to enable unprivileged user namespace creation *inside* the container -- most container runtimes apply a seccomp-bpf profile which blocks `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` inside containers regardless of whether the container itself uses user namespaces.\n\n  Rootless containers can provide even more protection if your configuration can use them -- by having runc itself be an unprivileged process, in general you would expect the impact scope of a runc bug to be less severe as it would only have the privileges afforded to the host user which spawned runc. \n\n- For non-user namespaced containers, configure all containers you spawn to not permit processes to run with root privileges. In most cases this would require configuring the container to use a non-root user and enabling `noNewPrivileges` to disable any setuid or set-capability binaries. (Note that this is runc's general recommendation for a secure container setup -- it is very difficult, if not impossible, to run an untrusted program with root privileges safely.) If you need to use `ping` in your containers, there is a `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` sysctl that can be used to allow unprivileged users to ping without requiring setuid or set-capability binaries.  \n - Do not run untrusted container images from unknown or unverified sources.  \n - Depending on the configuration of `maskedPaths`, an AppArmor profile (such as the default one applied by higher level runtimes including Docker and Podman) can block write attempts to most of `/proc` and `/sys`. This means that even with a procfs file maliciously bind-mounted to a `maskedPaths` target, all of the targets of `maskedPaths` in the default configuration of runtimes such as Docker or Podman will still not permit write access to said files. However, if a container is configured with a `maskedPaths` that is not protected by AppArmor then the same attack can be carried out. Please note that CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM labels, and so this mitigation is not that helpful when considered in combination with CVE-2025-52881.  \n - Based on runc's analysis, SELinux policies have a limited effect when trying to protect against this attack. The reason is that the `/dev/null` bind-mount gets implicitly relabelled with `context=...` set to the container's SELinux context, and thus the container process will have access to the source of the bind-mount even if they otherwise wouldn't.  \nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm  \n\n### Other Runtimes ###  \nAs this vulnerability boils down to a fairly easy-to-make logic bug, runc has provided information to other OCI (crun, youki) and non-OCI (LXC) container runtimes about this vulnerability. Based on discussions with other runtimes, it seems that crun and youki may have similar security issues and will release a coordinated security release along with runc. LXC appears to also be vulnerable in some aspects, but [their security stance](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/) is (understandably) that non-user-namespaced containers are fundamentally insecure by design.  \nhttps://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/  \n\n### Credits ###  \nThanks to Lei Wang (@ssst0n3 from Huawei) for finding and reporting the original vulnerability (Attack 1), and Li Fubang (@lifubang from acmcoder.com, CIIC) for discovering another attack vector (Attack 2) based on @ssst0n3's initial findings.\n",

                "text": "### Impact ###\nThis attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). \n\nIn runc version 1.0.0-rc3 and later, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). \n\nThe reason that the attacker can gain write access to these files is because the `/dev/console` bind-mount happens before `maskedPaths` and `readonlyPaths` are applied.\n\n#### Additional Findings ####\nWhile investigating this issue, runc discovered some other theoretical issues that may or may not be exploitable, as well as taking the opportunity to fix some fairly well-known issues related to consoles.\n\n##### Issue 1: Problematic Usage of `os.Create` #####\nGo provides an `os.Create` function for creating files, which older code in runc (dating back to the original `libcontainer` from the early 2010s) had a tendency to use fairly liberally. `os.Create` implies `O_CREAT|O_TRUNC` but by design it does not apply `O_NOFOLLOW` nor `O_EXCL`, meaning if the target is swapped with a malicious symlink runc can be tricked into truncating host files (which can lead to denial of service attacks, among other concerns). \n\nRunc conducted an audit of all `os.Create` usages in runc and found some suspicious usages related to device inodes, but based on runc's testing these were not exploitable in practice. Runc now has custom code lints to block any `os.Create` usage in runc, and plan to do a further audit of any other plain `os.*` operation usage throughout runc after this advisory becomes public. \n\nCVE-2024-45310 was a similar attack but without the `O_TRUNC` component (which resulted in a \"Low\" severity) -- a similar attack being exploitable would've been much more severe.\n\n##### Issue 2: Malicious `/dev/pts/$n` Inode Attacks (`TIOCGPTPEER`) #####\nThe (very) classic API for constructing consoles involves first opening `/dev/ptmx` for reading and writing. This allocates a new pseudo-terminal and the returned file descriptor is the \"master\" end (which is used by higher-level runtimes to do I/O with the container). \n\nTraditionally, in order to get the \"slave\" end, you do `ioctl(ptm, TIOCGPTN)` to get the pseudo-terminal number and then open the file in `/dev/pts/` with the corresponding base-10 decimal number of the number returned by `TIOCGPTN`. The naive way of doing this is vulnerable to very basic race attacks where `/dev/pts/$n` is replaced with a different pseudo-terminal or other malicious file. \n\nIn order to provide a mechanism to mitigate this risk, Aleksa Sarai (@cyphar from SUSE) implemented `TIOCGPTPEER` back in 2017 to provide a race-free way of doing the last `TIOCGPTN` step by opening the peer end of the pseudo-terminal directly. However, at the time it was believed to be too impractical to implement this protection in runc due to its no-monitor-process architecture (unlike runtimes like LXC which made use of `TIOCGPTPEER` almost immediately). While working on this advisory, runc found a way to make `TIOCGPTN` usage on pre-4.13 kernels still safe against race attacks and so have implemented both `TIOCGPTPEER` support as well as safe `TIOCGPTN` support as a fallback. \n\nAnother possible target of attack would be replacing `/dev/ptmx` or `/dev/pts/ptmx` with a different inode and tricking runc into trying to operate on it. This is very similar to the core issue in CVE-2025-31133 and had a similar solution. \n\nRunc's analysis was that while this attack appears to be potentially problematic in theory, it seems unlikely to actually be exploitable due to how consoles are treated (runc tries to do several pseudo-terminal-specific `ioctl`s and will error out if they fail -- which happens for most other file types). In principle you could imagine a DoS attack using a disconnected NFS handle but it seems impractical to exploit. However, runc felt it prudent to include a solution (and this also provides a safe mechanism to get the source mount for the `/dev/console` bind-mount issue at the beginning of this advisory).\n\n### Patches ###\nThis advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:\n\n  * CVE-2025-31133\n  * CVE-2025-52881\n  * CVE-2025-52565\n\nThe patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset. The following patches from that patchset resolve the issues in this advisory:\n\n * db19bbed5348 (\"internal/sys: add VerifyInode helper\")\n * ff94f9991bd3 (\"*: switch to safer securejoin.Reopen\")\n * 531ef794e4ec (\"console: use TIOCGPTPEER when allocating peer PTY\")\n * 398955bccb7f (\"console: add fallback for pre-TIOCGPTPEER kernels\")\n * 9be1dbf4ac67 (\"console: avoid trivial symlink attacks for /dev/console\")\n * de87203e625c (\"console: verify /dev/pts/ptmx before use\")\n * 01de9d65dc72 (\"rootfs: avoid using os.Create for new device inodes\")\n * aee7d3fe355d (\"ci: add lint to forbid the usage of os.Create\")\n\nrunc 1.2.8, 1.3.3, and 1.4.0-rc.3 have been released and all contain fixes for these issues. As per [runc's new release model](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md), runc 1.1.x and earlier are no longer supported and thus have not been patched.\n\n[CVE-2025-31133]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2\n[CVE-2025-52565]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r\n[CVE-2025-52881]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm\n[RELEASES.md]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.4.0-rc.2/RELEASES.md\n\n### Mitigations ###\n* Use containers with user namespaces (with the host root user not mapped into the container's user namespace). This will block most of the most serious aspects of these attacks, as the `procfs` files used for the container breakout use Unix DAC permissions and user namespaced users will not have access to the relevant files. \n\nAn attacker would still be able to bind-mount host paths into the container but if the host uids and gids mapped into the container do not overlap with ordinary users on the host (which is the generally recommended configuration) then the attacker would likely not be able to read or write to most sensitive host files (depending on the Unix DAC permissions of the host files). Note that this is still technically more privilege than an unprivileged user on the host -- because the bind-mount is done by a privileged process, the attacker would be able to get access to directories whose parents may have denied search access (i.e., they may be able to access paths inside a `chmod 700` directory that would normally block them from resolving subpaths). \n\nRunc would also like to take this opportunity to re-iterate that runc **strongly** recommend all users use user namespaced containers. They have proven to be one of the best security hardening mechanisms against container breakouts, and the kernel applies additional restrictions to user namespaced containers above and beyond the user remapping functionality provided. With the advent of id-mapped mounts (Linux 5.12), there is very little reason to not use user namespaces for most applications. Note that using user namespaces to configure your container does not mean you have to enable unprivileged user namespace creation *inside* the container -- most container runtimes apply a seccomp-bpf profile which blocks `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` inside containers regardless of whether the container itself uses user namespaces. \n\nRootless containers can provide even more protection if your configuration can use them -- by having runc itself be an unprivileged process, in general you would expect the impact scope of a runc bug to be less severe as it would only have the privileges afforded to the host user which spawned runc. \n\n * For non-user namespaced containers, configure all containers you spawn to not permit processes to run with root privileges. In most cases this would require configuring the container to use a non-root user and enabling `noNewPrivileges` to disable any setuid or set-capability binaries. (Note that this is runc's general recommendation for a secure container setup -- it is very difficult, if not impossible, to run an untrusted program with root privileges safely.) If you need to use `ping` in your containers, there is a `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` sysctl that can be used to allow unprivileged users to ping without requiring setuid or set-capability binaries. \n * Do not run untrusted container images from unknown or unverified sources.\n * The default `containers-selinux` SELinux policy mitigates this issue, as (unlike CVE-2025-31133) the `/dev/console` bind-mount does not get relabeled and so the container process cannot write to the bind-mounted procfs file by default.\n\n   Please note that CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM labels, and so this mitigation is not that helpful when considered in combination with CVE-2025-52881.\n\n * The default AppArmor policy used by Docker and Podman does not mitigate this issue (as access to `/dev/console`) is usually permitted. Users could create a custom profile that blocks access to `/dev/console`, but such a profile might break regular containers.\n\n   Please note that CVE-2025-52881 allows an attacker to bypass LSM labels, and so the mitigation provided with a custom profile is not that helpful when considered in combination with CVE-2025-52881.\n\n[CVE-2025-31133]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2\n[CVE-2025-52881]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm\n\n### Other Runtimes ###\nAs this vulnerability boils down to a fairly easy-to-make logic bug,runc has provided information to other OCI (crun, youki) and non-OCI (LXC) container runtimes about this vulnerability.\n\nBased on discussions with other runtimes, it seems that crun and youki may have similar security issues and will release a co-ordinated security release along with runc.

                "markdown": "> ### Impact ###\nThis attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). \n\nIn runc version 1.0.0-rc3 and later, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). \n\nThe reason that the attacker can gain write access to these files is because the `/dev/console` bind-mount happens before `maskedPaths` and `readonlyPaths` are applied.\n\n#### Additional Findings ####\nWhile investigating this issue, runc discovered some other theoretical issues that may or may not be exploitable, as well as taking the opportunity to fix some fairly well-known issues related to consoles.\n\n##### Issue 1: Problematic Usage of `os.Create` #####\nGo provides an `os.Create` function for creating files, which older code in runc (dating back to the original `libcontainer` from the early 2010s) had a tendency to use fairly liberally. `os.Create` implies `O_CREAT|O_TRUNC` but by design it does not apply `O_NOFOLLOW` nor `O_EXCL`, meaning if the target is swapped with a malicious symlink runc can be tricked into truncating host files (which can lead to denial of service attacks, among other concerns). \n\nRunc conducted an audit of all `os.Create` usages in runc and found some suspicious usages related to device inodes, but based on runc's testing these were not exploitable in practice. Runc now has custom code lints to block any `os.Create` usage in runc, and plan to do a further audit of any other plain `os.*` operation usage throughout runc after this advisory becomes public. \n\nCVE-2024-45310 was a similar attack but without the `O_TRUNC` component (which resulted in a \"Low\" severity) -- a similar attack being exploitable would've been much more severe.\n\n##### Issue 2: Malicious `/dev/pts/$n` Inode Attacks (`TIOCGPTPEER`) #####\nThe (very) classic API for constructing consoles involves first opening `/dev/ptmx` for reading and writing. This allocates a new pseudo-terminal and the returned file descriptor is the \"master\" end (which is used by higher-level runtimes to do I/O with the container). \n\nTraditionally, in order to get the \"slave\" end, you do `ioctl(ptm, TIOCGPTN)` to get the pseudo-terminal number and then open the file in `/dev/pts/` with the corresponding base-10 decimal number of the number returned by `TIOCGPTN`. The naive way of doing this is vulnerable to very basic race attacks where `/dev/pts/$n` is replaced with a different pseudo-terminal or other malicious file. \n\nIn order to provide a mechanism to mitigate this risk, Aleksa Sarai (@cyphar from SUSE) implemented `TIOCGPTPEER` back in 2017 to provide a race-free way of doing the last `TIOCGPTN` step by opening the peer end of the pseudo-terminal directly. However, at the time it was believed to be too impractical to implement this protection in runc due to its no-monitor-process architecture (unlike runtimes like LXC which made use of `TIOCGPTPEER` almost immediately). While working on this advisory, runc found a way to make `TIOCGPTN` usage on pre-4.13 kernels still safe against race attacks and so have implemented both `TIOCGPTPEER` support as well as safe `TIOCGPTN` support as a fallback. \n\nAnother possible target of attack would be replacing `/dev/ptmx` or `/dev/pts/ptmx` with a different inode and tricking runc into trying to operate on it. This is very similar to the core issue in CVE-2025-31133 and had a similar solution. \n\nRunc's analysis was that while this attack appears to be potentially problematic in theory, it seems unlikely to actually be exploitable due to how consoles are treated (runc tries to do several pseudo-terminal-specific `ioctl`s and will error out if they fail -- which happens for most other file types). In principle you could imagine a DoS attack using a disconnected NFS handle but it seems impractical to exploit. However, runc felt it prudent to include a solution (and this also provides a safe mechanism to get the source mount for the `/dev/console` bind-mount issue at the beginning of this advisory).\n\n### Patches ###\nThis advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:\n\n  * CVE-2025-31133\n  * CVE-2025-52881\n  * CVE-2025-52565\n\nThe patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset.

                "text": "### Impact ###\n\nThis attack is primarily a more sophisticated version of CVE-2019-19921, which was a flaw which allowed an attacker to trick runc into writing the LSM process labels for a container process into a dummy `tmpfs` file and thus not apply the correct LSM labels to the container process. The mitigation runc applied for CVE-2019-19921 was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when runc writes LSM labels that those labels are actual procfs files.\n\nRather than using a fake `tmpfs` file for `/proc/self/attr/<label>`, an attacker could instead (through various means) make `/proc/self/attr/<label>` reference a real `procfs` file, but one that would still be a no-op (such as `/proc/self/sched`). This would have the same effect but would clear the \"is a procfs file\" check. Runc is aware that this kind of attack would be possible (even going so far as to discuss this publicly as \"future work\" at conferences), and runc is working on a far more comprehensive mitigation of this attack, but this security issue was disclosed before runc could complete this work.\n\nIn all known versions of runc, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to `/proc` to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (runc has also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with `docker buildx build` as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a `tmpfs` or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts.\n\nNote that while `/proc/self/attr/<label>` was the example used above (which is LSM-specific), this issue affect all writes to `/proc` in runc and thus also affects sysctls (written to `/proc/sys/...`) and some other APIs.\n\n#### Additional Impacts ####\n\nWhile investigating this issue, runc discovered that another risk with these redirected writes is that they could be redirected to dangerous files such as `/proc/sysrq-trigger` rather than just no-op files like `/proc/self/sched`. For instance, the default AppArmor profile name in Docker is `docker-default`, which when written to `/proc/sysrq-trigger` would cause the host system to crash.\n\nWhen this was discovered, runc conducted an audit of other write operations within runc and found several possible areas where runc could be used as a semi-arbitrary write gadget when combined with the above race attacks. The most concerning attack scenario was the configuration of sysctls. Because the contents of the sysctl are free-form text, an attacker could use a misdirected write to write to `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` and break out of the container (as described in CVE-2025-31133, kernel upcalls are not namespaced and so coredump helpers will run with complete root privileges on the host). Even if the attacker cannot configure custom sysctls, a valid sysctl string (when redirected to `/proc/sysrq-trigger`) can easily cause the machine to hang.\n\nNote that the fact that this attack allows you to disable LSM labels makes it a very useful attack to combine with CVE-2025-31133 (as one of the only mitigations available to most users for that issue is AppArmor, and this attack would let you bypass that). However, the misdirected write issue above means that you could also achieve most of the same goals without needing to chain together attacks.\n\n### Patches ###\n\nThis advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:\n\n  * CVE-2025-31133\n  * CVE-2025-52881\n  * CVE-2025-52565\n\nThe patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset.

For most AppArmor deployments this means it will be `unconfined`, and for SELinux it will likely be `container_runtime_t`. Runc has not conducted in-depth testing of the impact on SELinux -- it is possible that it provides some reasonable protection but it seems likely that an attacker could cause harm to systems even with such an SELinux setup.\n\n * For the more involved redirect and write gadget attacks, unfortunately most LSM profiles (including the standard container-selinux profiles) provide the container runtime access to sysctl files (including `/proc/sysrq-trigger`) and so LSMs likely do not provide much protection against these attacks.\n\n * Using rootless containers provides some protection against these kinds of bugs (privileged writes in runc being redirected) -- by having runc itself be an unprivileged process, in general you would expect the impact scope of a runc bug to be less severe as it would only have the privileges afforded to the host user which spawned runc. For this particular bug, the privilege escalation caused by the inadvertent write issue is entirely mitigated with rootless containers because the unprivileged user that the `runc` process is executing as cannot write to the aforementioned procfs files (even intentionally).\n\n### Other Runtimes ###\n\nAs this vulnerability boils down to a fairly easy-to-make logic bug, runc has provided information to other OCI (crun, youki) and non-OCI (LXC) container runtimes about this vulnerability.\n\nBased on discussions with other runtimes, it seems that crun and youki may have similar security issues and will release a co-ordinated security release along with runc. LXC appears to use the host's `/proc` for all procfs operations, and so is likely not vulnerable to this issue (this is a trade-off -- runc uses the container's procfs to avoid CVE-2016-9962-style attacks).\n\n[CVE-2016-9962]: https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jan/21\n\n### Credits ###\n\nThanks to Li Fubang (@lifubang from acmcoder.com, CIIC) and Tõnis Tiigi (@tonistiigi from Docker) for both independently discovering this vulnerability, as well as Aleksa Sarai (@cyphar from SUSE) for the original research into this class of security issues and solutions.\n\nAdditional thanks go to Tõnis Tiigi for finding some very useful exploit templates for these kinds of race attacks using `docker buildx build`.\n",
                "markdown": "> ### Impact ###\n\nThis attack is primarily a more sophisticated version of CVE-2019-19921, which was a flaw which allowed an attacker to trick runc into writing the LSM process labels for a container process into a dummy `tmpfs` file and thus not apply the correct LSM labels to the container process. The mitigation runc applied for CVE-2019-19921 was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when runc writes LSM labels that those labels are actual procfs files.\n\nRather than using a fake `tmpfs` file for `/proc/self/attr/<label>`, an attacker could instead (through various means) make `/proc/self/attr/<label>` reference a real `procfs` file, but one that would still be a no-op (such as `/proc/self/sched`). This would have the same effect but would clear the \"is a procfs file\" check. Runc is aware that this kind of attack would be possible (even going so far as to discuss this publicly as \"future work\" at conferences), and runc is working on a far more comprehensive mitigation of this attack, but this security issue was disclosed before runc could complete this work.\n\nIn all known versions of runc, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to `/proc` to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (runc has also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with `docker buildx build` as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a `tmpfs` or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts.\n\nNote that while `/proc/self/attr/<label>` was the example used above (which is LSM-specific), this issue affect all writes to `/proc` in runc and thus also affects sysctls (written to `/proc/sys/...`) and some other APIs.\n\n#### Additional Impacts ####\n\nWhile investigating this issue, runc discovered that another risk with these redirected writes is that they could be redirected to dangerous files such as `/proc/sysrq-trigger` rather than just no-op files like `/proc/self/sched`. For instance, the default AppArmor profile name in Docker is `docker-default`, which when written to `/proc/sysrq-trigger` would cause the host system to crash.\n\nWhen this was discovered, runc conducted an audit of other write operations within runc and found several possible areas where runc could be used as a semi-arbitrary write gadget when combined with the above race attacks. The most concerning attack scenario was the configuration of sysctls. Because the contents of the sysctl are free-form text, an attacker could use a misdirected write to write to `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` and break out of the container (as described in CVE-2025-31133, kernel upcalls are not namespaced and so coredump helpers will run with complete root privileges on the host). Even if the attacker cannot configure custom sysctls, a valid sysctl string (when redirected to `/proc/sysrq-trigger`) can easily cause the machine to hang.\n\nNote that the fact that this attack allows you to disable LSM labels makes it a very useful attack to combine with CVE-2025-31133 (as one of the only mitigations available to most users for that issue is AppArmor, and this attack would let you bypass that). However, the misdirected write issue above means that you could also achieve most of the same goals without needing to chain together attacks.\n\n### Patches ###\n\nThis advisory is being published as part of a set of three advisories:\n\n  * CVE-2025-31133\n  * CVE-2025-52881\n  * CVE-2025-52565\n\nThe patches fixing this issue have accordingly been combined into a single patchset. The following patches from that patchset resolve the issues in this advisory:\n\n * db19bbed5348 (\"internal/sys: add VerifyInode helper\")\n * 6fc191449109 (\"internal: move utils.MkdirAllInRoot to internal/pathrs\")\n * ff94f9991bd3 (\"*: switch to safer securejoin.Reopen\")\n * 44a0fcf685db (\"go.mod: update to github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin@v0.5.0\")\n * 77889b56db93 (\"internal: add wrappers for securejoin.Proc*\")\n * fdcc9d3cad2f (\"apparmor: use safe procfs API for labels\")\n * ff6fe1324663 (\"utils: use safe procfs for /proc/self/fd loop code\")\n * b3dd1bc562ed (\"utils: remove unneeded EnsureProcHandle\")\n * 77d217c7c377 (\"init: write sysctls using safe procfs API\")\n * 435cc81be6b7 (\"init: use securejoin for /proc/self/setgroups\")\n * d61fd29d854b (\"libct/system: use securejoin for /proc/$pid/stat\")\n * 4b37cd93f86e (\"libct: align param type for mountCgroupV1/V2 functions\")\n * d40b3439a961 (\"rootfs: switch to fd-based handling of mountpoint targets\")\n * ed6b1693b8b3 (\"selinux: use safe procfs API for labels\")\n   - Please note that this patch includes a private patch for `github.com/opencontainers/selinux` that could not be made public through a public pull request (as it would necessarily disclose this embargoed security issue).\n\n     The patch includes a complete copy of the forked code and a `replace` directive (as well as `go mod vendor` applied), which should still work with downstream build systems. If you cannot apply this patch, you can safely drop it -- some of the other patches in this series should block these kinds of racing mount attacks entirely.\n\n     See https://github.com/opencontainers/selinux/pull/237 for the upstream patch.\n * 3f925525b44d (\"rootfs: re-allow dangling symlinks in mount targets\")\n * a41366e74080 (\"openat2: improve resilience on busy systems\")\n\nrunc 1.2.8, 1.3.3, and 1.4.0-rc.3 have been released and all contain fixes for these issues.

                "text": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).\n\n|                |                                                                                           |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.10?os_distro=focal&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=20.04 |\n| Affected range | <1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.12                                                                       |\n| Fixed version  | 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.12                                                                        |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                       7.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H                                              |\n"

Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts.\n3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector.\n\nThe combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue.\n\nWith fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations.\n\nIn addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms:\n\n1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=.\n2.

                "markdown": "> Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts.\n\nThis stems from several causes:\n\n1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended.\n2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts.\n3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector.\n\nThe combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue.\n\nWith fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations.\n\nIn addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms:\n\n1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=.\n2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts.

              "help": {
                "text": "### Impact\n\nIn runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\n\nStrictly speaking, while attack 3a is the most severe from a CVSS perspective, attacks 2 and 3b are arguably more dangerous in practice because they allow for a breakout from inside a container as opposed to requiring a user execute a malicious image. The reason attacks 1 and 3a are scored higher is because being able to socially engineer users is treated as a given for UI:R vectors, despite attacks 2 and 3b requiring far more minimal user interaction (just reasonable `runc exec` operations on a container the attacker has access to). In any case, all four attacks can lead to full control of the host system.\n\n#### Attack 1: `process.cwd` \"mis-configuration\"\n\nIn runc 1.1.11 and earlier, several file descriptors were inadvertently leaked internally within runc into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\n\nFurthermore, prior to runc 1.1.12, runc also did not verify that the final working directory was inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it was incorrectly assumed there would be no way to chdir outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\n\nThe CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (8.2, high severity).\n\nNote that this attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\n\n#### Attack 2: `runc exec` container breakout\n\n(This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\n\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\n\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\n\nThe CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (7.2, high severity).\n\n#### Attacks 3a and 3b: `process.args` host binary overwrite attack\n\n(These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\n\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in CVE-2019-5736 (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.\n\nFor the purposes of CVSS scoring:\n\n* Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.6, high severity).\n* Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.2, high severity).\n\nAs mentioned in attack 1, while 3b is scored lower it is more dangerous in practice as it doesn't require a user to run a malicious image.\n\n### Patches\nrunc 1.1.12 has been released, and includes patches for this issue. Note that there are four separate fixes applied:\n\n* Checking that the working directory is actually inside the container by checking whether `os.Getwd` returns `ENOENT` (Linux provides a way of detecting if cwd is outside the current namespace root). This explicitly blocks runc from executing a container process when inside a non-container path and thus eliminates attacks 1 and 2 even in the case of fd leaks.\n* Close all internal runc file descriptors in the final stage of `runc init`, right before `execve`. This ensures that internal file descriptors cannot be used as an argument to `execve` and thus eliminates attacks 3a and 3b, even in the case of fd leaks. This requires hooking into some Go runtime internals to make sure we don't close critical Go internal file descriptors.\n* Fixing the specific fd leaks that made these bug exploitable (mark `/sys/fs/cgroup` as `O_CLOEXEC` and backport a fix for some `*os.File` leaks).\n* In order to protect against future `runc init` file descriptor leaks, mark all non-stdio files as `O_CLOEXEC` before executing `runc init`.\n\n### Other Runtimes\n\nWe have discovered that several other container runtimes are either potentially vulnerable to similar attacks, or do not have sufficient protection against attacks of this nature. We recommend other container runtime authors look at [our patches](#Patches) and make sure they at least add a `getcwd() != ENOENT` check as well as consider whether `close_range(3, UINT_MAX, CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC)` before executing their equivalent of `runc init` is appropriate.\n\n * crun 1.12 does not leak any useful file descriptors into the `runc init`-equivalent process (so this attack is _not exploitable_ as far as we can tell), but no care is taken to make sure all non-stdio files are `O_CLOEXEC` and there is no check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. If a file descriptor happened to be leaked in the future, this could be exploitable. In addition, any file descriptors passed to `crun` are not closed until the container process is executed, meaning that easily-overlooked programming errors by users of `crun` can lead to these attacks becoming exploitable.\n * youki 0.3.1 does not leak any useful file descriptors into the `runc init`-equivalent process (so this attack is _not exploitable_ as far as we can tell) however this appears to be pure luck. `youki` does leak a directory file descriptor from the host mount namespace, but it just so happens that the directory is the rootfs of the container (which then gets `pivot_root`'d into and so ends up as a in-root path thanks to `chroot_fs_refs`). In addition, no care is taken to make sure all non-stdio files are `O_CLOEXEC` and there is no check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. If a file descriptor happened to be leaked in the future, this could be exploitable. In addition, any file descriptors passed to `youki` are not closed until the container process is executed, meaning that easily-overlooked programming errors by users of `youki` can lead to these attacks becoming exploitable.\n * LXC 5.0.3 does not appear to leak any useful file descriptors, and they have comments noting the importance of not leaking file descriptors in `lxc-attach`. However, they don't seem to have any proactive protection against file descriptor leaks at the point of `chdir` such as using `close_range(...)` (they do have RAII-like `__do_fclose` closers but those don't necessarily stop all leaks in this context) nor do they have any check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. Unfortunately it seems they cannot use `CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC` because they don't need to re-exec themselves.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor attacks 1 and 2, only permit containers (and `runc exec`) to use a `process.cwd` of `/`. It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).\n\nFor attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.\n\nFor attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary you try to execute with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.\n\n### See Also\n* https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21626\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.12\n* The runc 1.1.12 merge commit https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/a9833ff391a71b30069a6c3f816db113379a4346, which contains the following security patches:\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/506552a88bd3455e80a9b3829568e94ec0160309\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0994249a5ec4e363bfcf9af58a87a722e9a3a31b\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/fbe3eed1e568a376f371d2ced1b4ac16b7d7adde\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/284ba3057e428f8d6c7afcc3b0ac752e525957df\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/b6633f48a8c970433737b9be5bfe4f25d58a5aa7\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/683ad2ff3b01fb142ece7a8b3829de17150cf688\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/e9665f4d606b64bf9c4652ab2510da368bfbd951\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Rory McNamara from Snyk for discovering and disclosing the original vulnerability (attack 1) to Docker, @lifubang from acmcoder for discovering how to adapt the attack to overwrite host binaries (attack 3a), and Aleksa Sarai from SUSE for discovering how to adapt the attacks to work as container breakouts using `runc exec` (attacks 2 and 3b).\n",
                "markdown": "> ### Impact\n\nIn runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\n\nStrictly speaking, while attack 3a is the most severe from a CVSS perspective, attacks 2 and 3b are arguably more dangerous in practice because they allow for a breakout from inside a container as opposed to requiring a user execute a malicious image. The reason attacks 1 and 3a are scored higher is because being able to socially engineer users is treated as a given for UI:R vectors, despite attacks 2 and 3b requiring far more minimal user interaction (just reasonable `runc exec` operations on a container the attacker has access to). In any case, all four attacks can lead to full control of the host system.\n\n#### Attack 1: `process.cwd` \"mis-configuration\"\n\nIn runc 1.1.11 and earlier, several file descriptors were inadvertently leaked internally within runc into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\n\nFurthermore, prior to runc 1.1.12, runc also did not verify that the final working directory was inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it was incorrectly assumed there would be no way to chdir outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\n\nThe CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (8.2, high severity).\n\nNote that this attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\n\n#### Attack 2: `runc exec` container breakout\n\n(This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\n\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\n\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\n\nThe CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (7.2, high severity).\n\n#### Attacks 3a and 3b: `process.args` host binary overwrite attack\n\n(These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\n\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in CVE-2019-5736 (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.\n\nFor the purposes of CVSS scoring:\n\n* Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.6, high severity).\n* Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.2, high severity).\n\nAs mentioned in attack 1, while 3b is scored lower it is more dangerous in practice as it doesn't require a user to run a malicious image.\n\n### Patches\nrunc 1.1.12 has been released, and includes patches for this issue. Note that there are four separate fixes applied:\n\n* Checking that the working directory is actually inside the container by checking whether `os.Getwd` returns `ENOENT` (Linux provides a way of detecting if cwd is outside the current namespace root). This explicitly blocks runc from executing a container process when inside a non-container path and thus eliminates attacks 1 and 2 even in the case of fd leaks.\n* Close all internal runc file descriptors in the final stage of `runc init`, right before `execve`. This ensures that internal file descriptors cannot be used as an argument to `execve` and thus eliminates attacks 3a and 3b, even in the case of fd leaks. This requires hooking into some Go runtime internals to make sure we don't close critical Go internal file descriptors.\n* Fixing the specific fd leaks that made these bug exploitable (mark `/sys/fs/cgroup` as `O_CLOEXEC` and backport a fix for some `*os.File` leaks).\n* In order to protect against future `runc init` file descriptor leaks, mark all non-stdio files as `O_CLOEXEC` before executing `runc init`.\n\n### Other Runtimes\n\nWe have discovered that several other container runtimes are either potentially vulnerable to similar attacks, or do not have sufficient protection against attacks of this nature.
