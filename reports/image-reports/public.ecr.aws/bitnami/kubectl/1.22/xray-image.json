          "full_description": "The `krb5` library is an implementation of the `Kerberos` Version 5 protocol, which is a widely used authentication protocol that provides secure authentication over insecure networks. The library contains the tools, APIs, and utilities necessary for applications and systems to integrate Kerberos for authentication and secure communication.\n\n`GSS tokens` are part of the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API) used to provide secure communication between applications. A `GSS wrap token` is essentially a chunk of data that encapsulates encrypted data required for authentication, integrity, and confidentiality during Kerberos communication.\n\nIn MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5), attackers can craft the plaintext `Extra Count` field of a confidential GSS krb5 wrap token, causing the unwrapped token to appear truncated to the application.\nIn a truncation attack, the attacker somehow craft the message to indicate the message has finished in a way that will prevent the recipient picking up the rest of the message. This kind of attacks may lead to authentication bypass but rely heavily on the attacker ability to MiTM.\n\nThe general structure of a wrap token contains a header which includes the `Extra Count` field and an encrypted part which includes the message.\nA wrap token with a different value of `Extra Count` field between the plaintext and encrypted copies will be erroneously accepted, which allows a message truncation attack.\n\nThe wrap token header structure is similar to:\n```\nTOK_ID      : 2 byte\nFlags       : 1 byte\nFiller      : 1 byte\nExtra Count : 2 byte\nRRC         : 2 byte\n// Data (Encrypted)\n```\n\nTo successfully exploit this vulnerability the attacker will have to override the RRC field and the encrypted data in a way which will cause the receiving application think it got all of the message. This may lead to several issues, from authentication bypass to DoS.",

          "short_description": "An integer overflow in PAC parser of Kerberos 5 can lead to remote code execution (on 32-bit systems) or denial of service (on all systems) when parsing a crafted Kerberos ticket.",
          "full_description": "[MIT Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a network authentication protocol that uses secret key cryptography to secure communications over a computer network. \n\n[Privilege Attribute Certificate](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Kerberos_PAC) (PAC) is a data structure that is used in the Kerberos network authentication protocol to store authorization data for a user. It is used to determine what resources a user is allowed to access and what actions they are allowed to perform. \n\nA PAC is typically embedded in a ticket that is issued by the Kerberos authentication server and passed to the client system when the user logs in. The client system uses the PAC to determine the user's permissions when the user attempts to access a resource.\n\nThe client system will send the ticket and the PAC to the resource server, which will use the information contained in the PAC to determine whether the user is allowed to access the resource. If the user is authorized, the resource server will grant access to the resource. If the user is not authorized, the resource server will deny access to the resource.\n\nThe Kerberos' PAC parser lacks a size check that prevents an integer overflow. A crafted PAC can either: \n- Cause a smaller-than-needed buffer allocation that will contain the PAC parsed data and can subsequently lead to a heap-buffer overflow which might lead to remote code execution (on 32-bit systems only),\n- Cause a bigger-than-needed buffer allocation which will lead to a read out-of-bounds and possible DoS.\n\nSince the PAC is parsed only after extraction from a decrypted ticket, the attacker needs to produce a ticket that the victim can decrypt. For that reason, among the services using Kerberos protocol, the Key Distribution Center (KDC) is an easy target as any authenticated attacker can print a ticket encrypted with their own long-term key and get the KDC to parse the PAC contained within. \n\n[A patch](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/ea92d2f0fcceb54a70910fa32e9a0d7a5afc3583#diff-3d55ac988ef62053c69e7250eee0396116679f0d1327cc441c8d8f20501700b4) was released for the MIT Kerberos. \nSamba implements their own version of Kerberos library and released a [patch](https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/patches/security/samba-4.17.3-security-2022-11-15.patch).\nHeimdal also released a [patch](https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/commit/d16a9db259c9d488fe8ab8622079c4ba6f9b760b).\n\nThis issue also impacts [Microsoft's Kerberos in Active Directory](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2022-42898.html).",

          "full_description": "The `krb5` library is an implementation of the Kerberos Version 5 protocol, which is a widely used authentication protocol that provides secure authentication over insecure networks. The library contains the tools, APIs, and utilities necessary for applications and systems to integrate Kerberos for authentication and secure communication.\n\n`GSS` tokens are part of the `Generic Security Services Application Program Interface` (GSS-API) used to provide secure communication between applications. A GSS token is essentially a chunk of data that encapsulates security information required for authentication, integrity, and confidentiality during Kerberos communication.\n\nIn MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5), an attacker can cause invalid memory reads during GSS message token handling by sending message tokens with invalid length fields, thus leading to denial of service.\n\nThe general structure of a wrap token contains a header, which includes fields such as `Extra Count`, and an encrypted part which includes the message.\n\nFor example, the vulnerability can be exploited in the following cases:\n\n* A wrap token with a 0 value for the `Extra Count` field, which is the header value for padding.\n* A wrap token with no header\n\nNote:\nThis attack rely heavily on the attacker ability to MiTM.",

It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\n\nA [Kerberos database](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/database.html) contains all of a realm’s Kerberos principals, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal. For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \n\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\n\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\n\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file. It can be done using the following command:\n```\nkdb5_util load -d DB_NAME DB_FILE \n```",

These frames include frame type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload.\n\nThe `HEADERS` frame type allows sending HTTP headers of, both, request and response. The `HEADERS` frame contains many flags.\nThe `CONTINUATION` frame type is similar to the `HEADER` frame, but it has just one flag: `END_HEADERS`. When it is not set, the peer knows that more headers are coming in the following `CONTINUATION` frames.\n\nThis mechanism allows an attacker to send an `HTTP/2` stream with `CONTINUATION` frames, without setting the `END_HEADERS` flag in any of the frames. This can cause denial-of-service when sending an excessive number of these crafted frames due to caching all frames in memory.\n\nThough the `net/http` package uses HTTP/2 by default, a Golang web server must have HTTPS configured to be vulnerable to exploitation.\nThe `x/net/http2` package is vulnerable by default.",

If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary ...",

Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access.

For instance, a header with a large number of newline characters may cause the function to over-allocate memory, resulting in memory exhaustion and a denial of service. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by crafting small requests, making it a relatively easy target for malicious activity.\n\nThis issue is dangerous since even a very simple Go HTTP server is remotely vulnerable to DoS.\n\nVulnerable code example -\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc hello(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n    fmt.Fprintf(w, \"hello\\n\")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/hello\", hello)\n    http.ListenAndServe(\":80\", nil)\n}\n```",

Golang compiler accepts compiler directives as comments (using `//` single line and `/*` multi-line comments). \n\nA [line directive](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-Compiler_Directives) specifies the source position for the character immediately following the comment as having come from the specified file. The following example specifies that the filename is foo.go and the line number is 10 for the next line in the source code.\n\n`//line foo.go:10` \n\nThe `cgo` package lets Go packages call C code and combines c files and go files into a single Go package. The cgo directives are used to provide flags for the compiler and linker when building the C parts of the package. For security reasons (may lead to code execution), the Golang command restricts the use of `cgo` directives (`//go:cgo_`) unless the file is generated by cgo.\n\nThe Golang compiler has a design problem in the implementation of the `isCgoGeneratedFile()` function, which leads to cgo directives restrictions being bypassed when handling crafted line directives followed by cgo directives. This function's purpose is to determine whether a file was generated by cgo or not, tricking this function is the key to bypassing the compiler restrictions. The following combination tricks the compiler into handling cgo directives as it is part of cgo-generated code (`_cgo_` prefix) although it is not.\n\n```\n//line /tmp/_cgo_.go:1\n//go:cgo_dynamic_linker \"/elf/interp\"\n```\n\nUsing the directives above tricks the compiler to use restricted cgo directives, which can lead to arbitrary code execution when running the `go build` command on the manipulated source code.\n\nThe line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which can make exploiting this issue more complex (may require per-target research).\n\nThe official fix solves this issue by correcting the implementation of the `isCgoGeneratedFile()` function to find the real position of a statement (not the position specified by the line directive).",

          "full_description": "Golang's [net/http/httputil](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil) package provides HTTP utility functions, complementing the ones in Golang's net/http package.\n\nGolang's [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) package provides HTTP client and server implementations in Golang.\n\nGolang's [net/url](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url) package is used for parsing URLs and query escaping.\n\nIn Go 1.17, URL parsing was changed to reject keys containing a semicolon. But despite the function `net/url.ParseQuery` being changed to raise an error when given a parameter with `;`, the function `net/url.URL.Query`, which calls the `net/url.ParseQuery`, ignores any error returned by it. Furthermore, the function `net/http/httputils.NewSingleHostReverseProxy` does not parse the query at all and sends the raw query to the backend.\n\nThis means that when there's a version discrepancy between the frontend and the backend - where the frontend uses a Go 1.17 or later, and the backend uses Go 1.16.x or earlier - it is possible for attackers to use parameter smuggling in order to bypass possible filters.\n\nTake for example the fictional website `https://mysite`, which uses Go 1.18 for its frontend and Go 1.16 for its backend. When going to `https://mysite/home`, the user's name is added as a parameter, e.g.  `https://mysite/home?name=sam`. In addition to the `name` parameter, it is possible to add a `role` parameter, which can be set to either `user` or `admin`. When the parameter is set to `admin` the frontend checks whether the user's name is that of an admin or not before forwarding the query to the backend.\n\nHowever,  when an attacker sends a request such as `https://mysite/home?role=admin;\u0026name=regularuser`, and the frontend parses it using `net/url.URL.Query`, the function will only return the `name=regularuser` parameter and raise no error. Since the frontend deems the request valid, it will pass it to the backend using `net/http/httputils.NewSingleHostReverseProxy`, which will pass the raw query instead of the parsed query from `net/url.URL.Query` to the backend. When the backend parses the query, both `name=regularuser` and `role=admin` will be returned. Thus, the attacker bypassed the frontend's filter.\n\nThe vulnerability does not exist if the frontend and the backend both use Go before 1.17 or Go after 1.17.",

It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.\n\nGo offers multiple built-in packages. One of them is [PEM package](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/pem), responsible for encoding and decoding PEM data like TLS keys or certificates. \n\nThe PEM's data decoding can be compromised to cause a stack overflow/exhaustion and thus, a denial of service. The bug was proven to be triggered when decoding a large PEM data containing errors. Errors were triggering a recursive call the `Decode` function itself. Recursive calls fill up the calling stack until the crash. \n\nThe bug was fixed in Go version 1.18.1 and 1.17.9. A proof-of-concept was [published](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/399820/1/src/encoding/pem/pem_test.go#164) as a test case.",

It is a standard package included in the Go standard library and is widely used in the development of secure applications that rely on elliptic curve cryptography.\nThe P256 elliptic curve is utilized in cryptographic protocols, specifically in the widespread deployment of the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signature scheme.\nIn elliptic curve cryptography, a scalar refers to a non-negative integer used for scalar multiplication with a point on the curve.\n\nA flaw discovered in this P256 elliptic curve can cause the application to panic and may lead to a denial of service.\nIf the input scalar is strictly longer than 32 bytes, the `P256().ScalarMult` or `P256().ScalarBaseMult` functions may perform an out-of-bound write, thus causing a Golang panic.\n\nNote: Indirect uses through `crypto/ecdsa` and `crypto/tls` are unaffected. `amd64`, `arm64`, `ppc64le` and `s390x` platforms are also unaffected.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n```\nfunc VulnExample(c elliptic.Curve, px *big.Int, py *big.Int) (int, error) {\n\th.ax, h.ay = c.ScalarBaseMult(h.s.Bytes())\n\ttx, ty := c.ScalarMult(px, py, h.s.Bytes())\n\th.bx, h.by = c.Add(tx, ty, c.Params().Gx, c.Params().Gy)\n\treturn DiscreteLog(h.bx, h,by, c, 1\u003c\u003c10)\n```",

        "summary": "Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.",

The `Decoder` object also supports skipping over XML elements (including their nested children) by calling the `Skip` method recursively.\n\nIt was discovered that when given a deeply nested XML document, the `(*Decoder).Skip` method will recurse many times, which may lead to stack exhaustion. This could cause the calling Golang process to crash.\n\nThe issue was fixed by replacing the recursion portion of the function with a depth counter. The depth counter will increase for each new start token, and while the depth counter is not 0, will decrease for each new end token.\n\nWhile `(*Decoder).Skip` may not be used directly, it is called by the widely used `(*Decoder).Decode`, `(*Decoder).DecodeElement` and `Unmarshal` functions.\n\nExample code snippets that are vulnerable to this issue -\n```go\ndecoder := xml.NewDecoder(attacker_input)\nerr := decoder.Skip()\n```\n\n```go\nerr := xml.Unmarshal(attacker_input, result_object)\n```\n\nThe vulnerable behavior can be exploited by attackers to cause denial of service, by providing crafted, deeply nested XML documents to one of the following API functions (from `encoding/xml`):\n\n1. `(*Decoder).Skip`\n2. `(*Decoder).Decode`\n3. `(*Decoder).DecodeElement`\n4. `Unmarshal`",

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning\nwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.",

When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme.

          "full_description": "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a popular distributed revision control system.\n\nFor displaying information about commits and other objects in the repository with more customization, Git introduced `pretty formats` through the `--pretty` option. For example, for displaying the log messages as follows`\u003ccommit-hash\u003e \u003ccommit-message\u003e \u003cauthor-name\u003e \u003cauthor-date\u003e`, the pretty option should be set as follow: `git log --pretty=format:\"%h %s %an %ad\"`.\n\nThe `format` mode also allows padding of the number of characters taken from the commit information with `padding`. This way, `git log --pretty=format:\"%h %B %20\u003c(20)%an %ad\"` would generate `\u003ccommit-hash\u003e \u003ccommit-message\u003e \u003cauthor-name-with-20-characters-width\u003e \u003cauthor-date\u003e`, thus padding the author-name to fit the number of character to 20. The width of the padding can be adjusted with the placeholders %\u003c(n) and %\u003e to specify left or right padding respectively.\n\nInteger overflows in the padding resolution logic lead to out-of-bounds write of the string defined by the format specifier, following the second padding specifier to a controlled offset. This can theoretically lead to code execution.\n\nThe exploitation of this issue depends on the attacker's ability to control the `--pretty` option in the `git log` that a user or an application would execute, which should be very rare.\n\nWhile attacking a Git client using this vulnerability would not be common because of the above prerequisite, the threat to Git server is more severe. The `pretty format` is also used in [git archive](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive) operations via the [export-subst](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#_export_subst) attribute. In order to exploit the vulnerability on the server side, an attacker should create a new repository on the targeted Git server, add a file with the `$Format:%\u003e(2147483645)\u003cPAYLOAD\u003e$` (for example, example.txt) and add the file in the `.gitattributes` file with the `export-subst` attribute as follow: `example.txt export-subst`. Executing `git archive` with the `--remote` flag will trigger the vulnerability directly on the server side. It will not crash the Git server as a thread is created when executing the `git archive` command (so the thread would only crash). However, as any hexadecimal can be written, exploiting it for code execution seems possible. \n\nNote that some Git hosting services like GitHub block the `git archive` command.\n\nIf `git archive` is exposed via `git daemon`, it can be disabled by running `git config --global daemon.uploadArch false`.",

        "summary": "In Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, no localized messages are shipped with the installer. As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function's implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.\n\nThis vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`.",

This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a \"proper\" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.",

This function improperly uses an `int` to represent the number of entries in the arguments array, allowing an attacker to intentionally overflow the return value, leading to a heap overflow.\n\nThe size of `int` is 32-bit, which is around 2GB. An attacker needs to pass more than 2GB of data to cause the overflow, which is unlikely to be possible over SSH and also limited by the size of arguments the OS is willing to pass.\n\nEvery call to the `execve` functions family conforms to a Linux limit that limits the use of the stack. This limit affects the vulnerable buffer size in this vulnerability in practice. The maximum length of arguments for a new process may differ among Linux distributions.\n\nAlso, the input to `git-shell` resides 4 times in memory, so to overflow 2GB in memory - 8GB needs to be allocated. This increases the chance of crashing the process due to possible out-of-memory.\n\nThis issue is unlikely to be exploited because it requires `git shell` to be configured as a login shell, and interactive mode to be enabled by having the `$HOME/git-shell-commands` directory present, which is non-default.",

For example, this can be achieved by setting the `core.fsmonitor` variable in the repository's git configuration to an arbitrary malicious command.\n\nIt was discovered that the \"safe directory\" mechanism that refuses parsing the git configuration in foreign directories is not 100% effective, since it does not work for directories that are owned by the privilege user, but are still writable by the attacker.\nThe most common example of this is the `/tmp` directory, which is root-owned and world-writable.\nA malicious attacker may leave a crafted `.gitconfig` file in the `/tmp` folder, which will cause arbitrary commands to be run if the root user runs any git command (ex. `git status`) from the `/tmp` directory.\nThe issue was fixed by adding a check for the ownership of the git config file, instead of just the git directory.",

In order for this attack to work, the symbolic link must already exist in the folder where the patch is being applied. When the Git Apply function processes the patch file, it first analyzes all the files present in the working directory, including their types. However, when the patch file copies a symbolic link to another location, the type of the copied file is not checked before processing other lines in the patch file. This means that a copied symbolic link can be used to write/delete files outside the working directory, compromising the security of the system.\n\nExample of malicious patch file:\n```\ndiff --git a/symlink b/renamed-symlink\nsimilarity index 100%\nrename from symlink\nrename to renamed-symlink\n--\ndiff --git /dev/null b/renamed-symlink/../../../../tmp/malicious-file\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..039727e\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/renamed-symlink/create-me\n@@ -0,0 +1,1 @@\n+busted\n```\nGiving symlink is an existing Symbolic Link, the `git apply` command on this file writes the `/tmp/malicious-file` file outside the working directory.\n\nNote that the `git apply` can write a file only in the allowed path for this user, thus, executing this command as a low-privileged user limits the potential writing capability to only directories it can write into.",

Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.\n\nA fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is impractical, two short-term workarounds are available. Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`. Instead, consider cloning repositories without recursively cloning their submodules, and instead run `git submodule update` at each layer. Before doing so, inspect each new `.gitmodules` file to ensure that it does not contain suspicious module URLs.",

It is processed and checked by Git during various operations, including clone, pull, merge, and checkout.\n\nThe lack of proper checks in the parsing of the `.gitattributes` file can result in multiple integer overflows when the file contains a large number of attributes, specifically at least 2^32-1 attributes. Given that the minimal size of an attribute is 3 characters, this translates to a minimal file size of approximately 12GB.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a large`.gitattributes` file and pushing it to a repository that is being cloned, checked out, or pulled by a vulnerable Git client.

The `net-update` function pulls the signing keys that should be added from an insecure location (`http://...`), exposing it to a Man-in-the-Middle attack in which malicious signing keys could be added to the system's keyring. This issue happens due to a vulnerability in the `add_keys_with_veirfy_against_master_keyring()` function, which allows adding signing keys without proper signature validation. \n\nThis vulnerability then potentially allows a malicious actor to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack on a target, by making it validate malicious packages that were signed with the `GPG` signing key used by the attacker. Effectively, this means that `apt` can be duped to install malicious services and daemons with root privileges.\n\nThe conditions for this vulnerability to be applicable:\n \n1. A valid URI should be configured in `ARCHIVE_KEYRING_URI` variable in the file `/usr/bin/apt-key`. This is the URI that an attacker would need to target in a Man In The Middle attack.\n2.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.",

          "full_description": "[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is a software library for applications that provide secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the other end. It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.\n\n`BIO_new_NDEF` is a helper function in OpenSSL that is used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. NDEF stands for `Nested ASN.1 Data Encoding Format`. Specifically, it pre-pends a new `BIO_f_asn1` filter BIO onto the front of a given BIO chain and returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. This function is primarily used internally in OpenSSL to support the streaming capabilities of the SMIME, CMS, and PKCS7 protocols, but it may also be called directly by end-user applications.\n\nAn issue has been detected in the `BIO_new_NDEF` function. If the new filter BIO created by the function is freed due to a failure, such as an invalid CMS recipient public key, the input BIO that was passed to `BIO_new_NDEF` is still pointing to the freed filter BIO. If the caller then calls the `BIO_pop()` function on the input BIO, a use-after-free will occur, which can result in a crash or other unpredictable behavior. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) by crafting a malicious input that triggers the use-after-free condition.\n\nCalling any of the following functions with external data may trigger this issue -\n```\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream\nPEM_write_bio_CMS_stream\nPEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream\nSMIME_write_ASN1\nSMIME_write_CMS\nSMIME_write_PKCS7\nBIO_new_CMS\nBIO_new_PKCS7\ni2d_CMS_bio_stream\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream\nBIO_new_NDEF\n```",

It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.\n\nAn issue in OpenSSL's PEM file parsing code could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack by supplying a specially crafted PEM file.\nAn attacker could exploit it by crafting a malicious PEM file that triggers the bug in the PEM file parsing code. Specifically, the attacker could create a PEM file that contains zero bytes of payload data, which would cause the `PEM_read_bio_ex()` function to return a failure code. However, the header argument would still be populated with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer, then a double free will occur, which can lead to a crash or other unpredictable behavior.\nNote that the `PEM_read_bio_ex()` function is very widespread in the OpenSSL library and is called through wrapper functions like `PEM_read_bio()` / `PEM_read()` and also indirectly through other functions like `PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex()` and `SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()`.\nThe `asn1parse` command line application is also impacted by this issue.\n\nIf the attacker can convince a victim to process the malicious PEM file, such as by tricking the victim into opening an email attachment or visiting a website that contains the file, then the `PEM_read_bio_ex()` function would be called and could potentially crash the application or cause it to behave unpredictably.\n\nIf the application is a server-side application, then the attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted PEM file to the server, such as in an HTTP request, and causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.\n\nTo trigger the vulnerability, the attackers would need to know how to construct a malicious PEM file that triggers the bug in the PEM file parsing code. They would also need to find a way to convince the victim to process the file, such as by using social engineering techniques or exploiting vulnerabilities in other software that the victim uses.",

The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of ...",

Next, based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.",

          "full_description": "OpenSSL is an open-source cryptographic library and toolset that provides a wide range of protocol supported and functions for secure communication, data encryption, digital certificates, and other cryptographic operations, widely used in various software applications and systems.\nAn `Object Identifier (OID)` is represented as a series of sub-identifiers, which are numbers separated by periods. These sub-identifiers form a hierarchical structure, allowing for the unique identification of objects, algorithms, or protocols. For example, the OID \"1.2.840.10045.2.1\" represents the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in decimal form.\n\nThe function `OBJ_obj2txt()` in OpenSSL allows the translation of an `ASN.1 Object Identifier` into its canonical numeric text form. This canonical form represents the sub-identifiers of the Object Identifier in decimal form, with each sub-identifier separated by periods.\n\nAn issue in this function has been discovered: the number of sub-identifiers is not limited. As the computing time of the translation is quadratic, an attacker-controlled Object identifier can craft a large one with a big sub-identifier and may cause a denial of service.\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.x, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names/identifiers in a String form was introduced. This includes using Object Identifiers in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms.\n\nFor OpenSSL 3.x, `OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF, or TS` are vulnerable but not `TLS` (100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain) except if it has `client_authentication` enabled.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n```c\n    basic_resp = d2i_OCSP_BASICRESP_bio(bio, NULL);\n    if (!basic_resp) {\n        printf(\"Error parsing OCSP response\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Load the certificate to verify against\n    cert = X509_new();\n    if (!cert) {\n        printf(\"Error creating X509 certificate object\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    if (!X509_load_cert_file(cert, \"certificate.pem\")) {\n        printf(\"Error loading certificate\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Verify the OCSP response\n    int status = OCSP_basic_verify(basic_resp, cert, NULL, 0);\n    if (status == 1) {\n        printf(\"OCSP response is valid\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"OCSP response verification failed\\n\");\n    }\n```\nThe function `OCSP_basic_verify()` is calling indirectly the vulnerable `OBJ_obj2txt()` function and is processing an external response that can be used by an attacker to trigger the issue.",

The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,\nRSA-OEAP and RSASVE.\n\nFor example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an\nencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a\ngenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send\ntrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a\nsufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master\nsecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the\napplication data sent over that connection.",

Its true type is `ASN1_STRING` but it was treated as a `ASN1_TYPE` type.\n\nThe issue may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to the `memcmp` call, enabling them to read memory contents or create a denial of service.\n\nThe vulnerability requires the attacker to provide OpenSSL with both a crafted certificate chain and certificate revocation list (CRL), and CRL checking to be enabled.\n\nThe issue is highly unlikely to be exploited due to the following reasons:\n1.

          "short_description": "Insufficient separation in `pam_namespace` may lead to local privilege escalation",
          "full_description": "The `pam_namespace` module is part of the Linux PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) system. Its goal is to enhance user isolation by creating private mount namespaces for each user session. Within these namespaces, it can polyinstantiate certain directories (like `/tmp` or `$HOME`), giving each user or session a private version that’s hidden from others. This helps prevent information leaks, symlink attacks, and other types of local privilege escalation in multi-user environments.\n\n`pam_namespace` is designed to isolate user directories using mount namespaces. However, due to incomplete protection against symlink/race condition attacks, an unprivileged user can potentially gain root access.\nThe attacker must be able to launch a controlled process outside of their PAM session, by doing so they will be able to alter the paths on which `pam_namespace` is operating as root.\n\nThis can allow attackers to -\n1. Launch symlink attacks on a path used by `pam_namespace` during polyinstantiation setup\n2. Launch race condition attacks on the security checks in `pam_namespace`\nEither of these can allow the local attacker to escalate privileges to root\n\nThis is more feasible if:\n1. The system has multiple users colluding with each other or-\n2. PAM services are misconfigured and do not call `pam_namespace`\n\n\nExamples:\n\n1. If two users on the same system are either colluding or both compromised, one of them can tamper with the paths used to polyinstantiate directories for the other. This is possible because each user operates within their own PAM session, which places them in a separate mount namespace. As a result, the restrictions enforced by `pam_namespace` do not apply across these namespaces, allowing one user to interfere with the other's environment.\n\n2. If a PAM service is misconfigured and fails to invoke `pam_namespace` during the creation of a new PAM session, it opens up a potential security gap. This kind of misconfiguration is not uncommon, as some packages provide PAM service files that omit the standard, distribution-provided configuration files (like `common-session` or `system-auth`).",

It was discovered that the response time to this key exchange depends on the size of encrypted data when processing PKCS#1 v1.5 encrypted data. An attacker might be able to perform a timing side-channel attack to extract information about the RSA key by observing the time it takes to perform this operation.\n\nThe specific possible side-channel attack due to this issue is called [Bleichenbacher's Attack](https://medium.com/@c0D3M/bleichenbacher-attack-explained-bc630f88ff25) and requires timing the server responses by sending a large amount of different malformed RSA ciphertext messages.\n\nTo perform this attack, an attacker would need to be on the same machine or subnet where the decryption takes place and to be able to trigger many decryption operations (oracle attack).\n\nA successful attack would compromise the server's private RSA key, allowing the attacker to decrypt any sniffed TLS traffic sent to or from the server from any host.",

It is widely used by network and cryptography packages (e.g. GnuTLS).\nlibtasn1 implementation has an improper input validation of ETYPE, in the `ETYPE_OK` macro function. ETYPE is compared against the actual size of the ETYPE array `_asn1_tags_size` instead of `_asn1_tags_size -1` which leads the validation to pass with ETYPE out of range (when `ETYPE = _asn1_tags_size`).\n\n```\n# define ETYPE_OK(etype) (((etype) != ASN1_ETYPE_INVALID \u0026\u0026 \\\n                          (etype) \u003c= _asn1_tags_size \u0026\u0026 \\\n                          _asn1_tags[(etype)].desc != NULL)?1:0)\n```\n\nAn attacker can exploit this issue by providing the `_asn1_tags_size` value as the ETYPE value to `ETYPE_OK`, through multiple libtasn1 APIs (as demonstrated in the public exploit). Providing this ETYPE value causes a global buffer overflow (reads 8 bytes outside of a global array) and leads to denial of service in most cases.\n\nThe official solution fixes the bug by comparing ETYPE with `_asn1_tags_size -1` as following:\n```\n(etype) \u003c _asn1_tags_size\n```",

          "full_description": "[CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/) (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) is a repository of over 200,000 modules for the Perl programming language. \n\nTo install Perl modules from CPAN, users can use either the `cpan` client provided by [CPAN.pm](https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN) (included in the Perl core) or the `cpanm` client provided by [cpanminus](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus).\n\nWhen downloading a module, the cpan client retrieves a tarball with an encrypted `CHECKSUMS` file. The client generates its own local `CHECKSUMS` file for the downloaded file and compares it to the downloaded CHECKSUMS file. **By default**, the client only compares the `CHECKSUMS` files content but **does not validate the authenticity of the downloaded `CHECKSUMS` file**. To enable this option in cpan, the user can run the following command: `o conf check_sigs 1` and to make the changes persistent, run `o conf commit` after the first command.\n\nHowever, even when signature checking is enabled, there is a flaw in the `CHECKSUMS` file validation logic. An attacker can add a prepended checksum for a modified package to the beginning of the `CHECKSUMS` file, which will cause the `Module::Signature::_verify()` function to pass and trigger the installation even though the return code is `CANNOT_VERIFY`, which will be considered as `SIGNATURE_OK`.\n\nThis issue can be used to carry out supply chain attacks, as demonstrated in the [PoC](https://blog.hackeriet.no/cpan-signature-verification-vulnerabilities/). The attacker must create their own CPAN mirror, change the targeted module to add its malicious behaviors, calculate the new checksums from its files and add the calculated checksum to the beginning of the associated `CHECKSUMS` file.",

This leads to a complete bypass of the \"stack protector\" mitigation.\n\nSpecifically, The stack protector (\"canary\") should protect an application from been exploited by stack-based buffer overflows. It is placed on stack frame in function prologue and checked with some trusted value in the function epilogue.\n\nFor x86 and x86-64 architecture the canary value is located in structure `tcbhead_t` field `stack_guard`. A Special register ('gs' for i386 and 'fs' for x86-64) keeps a pointer to this structure. The value `tcbhead_t.stack_guard` is compared with one on the stack to detect stack smashing.\n\nNPTL (Native POSIX Threads Library) is the GNU C library POSIX threads implementation that is used on modern Linux systems. When a `pthread` (new thread) is created, it will keep the `tcphead_t` structure in the thread stack. Thus, an attacker can overwrite the \"reference\" stack-canary value (since it's saved on the stack) by means of stack overflow in a new thread.\n\nThis vulnerability was disputed by the libc maintainers, since it is a well-known issue and not a standalone vulnerability but rather a vulnerability in a mitigation mechanism.",

By default, ncurses will search `${HOME}/.terminfo` first, then `/etc/terminfo`, then `/lib/terminfo`, and\n finally `/usr/share/terminfo`.\n\nTerminfo allows to declare user definable attributes, custom numbers or strings thatextend its standard capabilities.\nUsers can customize their own terminfo definitions by creating or modifying files within their `.terminfo`. \nThe `.terminfo` directory is typically located at `$HOME/.terminfo`, and users have the necessary privileges to modify the files within this directory. The default location can be overwritten by defining the `$TERMINFO` or `$TERM` environment variable.\nExample: `export TERMINFO=/my/terminfo/db/path`\n\nAn issue was discovered in the ncurses library's `_nc_read_termtype` function, responsible for parsing terminfo database file due to improper handling of heap allocation for `Strings` and `Extended Strings` within the `terminfo` file. The function fails to handle the allocation correctly, leading to a heap buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption issues.\nDue to the nature of the vulnerability, an attacker would mainly try to get local privilege escalation. Then, the only binaries that are vulnerable to this issue are the `SetUID binaries` that are using `ncurses`. \n \nThe exposed functions that call the `_nc_read_termtype` function are: `_nc_read_file_entry`, `initscr`, `setupterm` and `resttarterm` functions.\n\nNote that this issue can also be triggered by the ncurses's progs tools like `infocmp` and `tic`. However, they're not `setuid` binaries so they cannot be used for a privilege escalation.",

Common examples include `.bashrc` for `Bash`, `.bash_profile` for `Bash login shells`, and `.profile` for `POSIX-compliant shells`. The file is typically located in the user's home directory.\n2. Open the file with `root` access\n3. Add the following line to make the TERMINFO environment variable un-writtable: \n```\nexport TERMINFO=\nreadonly TERMINFO\n```\n4.

This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.\n\nA SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.",

When `systemd` is required to mount user-specified drives or directories, it recursively updates the `SELinux` labels of the files inside the mounted directory tree, granting privileges to the mounting user to use those files. A vulnerability in `systemd`'s `label_fix` function allows an attacker to perform a symlink attack, in which a symlink to a sensitive resource exists in the mounted directory tree.

This release will fix two security vulnerabilities in curl.\nOne of these vulnerabilities is rated as having low severity - CVE-2023-38546.\nAs of the current moment, no specific details (such as affected versions) have been released.\n\nWhile not much is known about CVE-2023-38545 the following has been verified by official sources -\n1. CVE-2023-38545 is “the worst security problem found in Curl in a long time”. For reference, the last vulnerability that was given a “High” severity by the Curl project is CVE-2021-22901 that was reported in May 2011.\n2. The vulnerability does not affect all users of Curl, the maintainers specifically mentioned “there is still going to be a large chunk of users who will not be affected by these problems” - probably due to attack preconditions of this vulnerability.\n3. The vulnerability is rated “High” although the Curl project does theoretically support designating vulnerabilities as “Critical” (this never happened so far). This may be related to the previous point - not all users are affected.\n4. There is no API nor ABI change in the coming curl release.\n\nThis advisory will be updated on October 11th 2023 as details emerge",

It was found that the `gzip_do_write()` function is susceptible to a buffer overflow as a result of an integer overflow. This could lead to remote code execution since the heap buffer overflow is controlled both in size and content. \n\nCurl supports endlessly large gzip headers, which result in the repeated call for `gzip_do_write()`, incrementing the `z-\u003eavail_in` variable, keeping track of the size of the buffer required for the gzip header data. Because there is no limit to the size of the gzip header data, this may result in `z-\u003eavail_in` overflowing, leading to the allocation of a buffer much smaller than the data being stored, resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\nThe vulnerability is only exploitable when Curl is running with very old versions of zlib (1.2.0.3 or older, which is 21+ years old) and when the `CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING` option is set to `gzip` (non-default value).",

HSTS exists to remove the need for the common, insecure practice of redirecting users from `http://` to `https://` URLs.\n\n[Internationalized Domain Names](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215864977-Internationalized-domain-names-IDNs-) (IDNs) are domain names that contain characters other than unaccented Roman letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the hyphen. For instance, `日本語.idn.icann.org` contains Japanese characters.\n\n`curl` features an in-memory cache for `HSTS` hosts, so subsequent `HTTP-only` requests to a hostname present in the cache will get internally \"redirected\" to the `HTTPS` version.\n\nIt was discovered that the `HSTS` mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL first uses `IDN` characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the `IDN` conversion. Like using the UTF-8 character `U+3002` (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common `ASCII` full stop (U+002E) `.`.

This allows the server to act as a proxy for the client, using the client's credentials to access resources that the client may not have direct access to.\n\nTo delegate credentials, the client establishes a GSS-API security context with the server, and if the client supports delegation and has valid credentials, sends a \"forwardable\" ticket to the server. The server can then use this ticket to access resources on behalf of the client. \n\nlibcurl can reuse a previously created connection even when the delegation option had been changed which could have made the effective user no longer have access, thus leading to doing the second transfer with the wrong permissions.\n\nSpecifically, connecting to the same server while changing the following setting - `CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION` (or `--delegation` in curl command line) will erroneously re-use a previously cached connection (if the previous connection has been made from the same process), which is unexpected.\n\nGSS-API delegation can also be used with Kerberos. When using Kerberos with GSS-API delegation, the client obtains a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) during authentication, which can be used by the server to obtain a service ticket for accessing resources on behalf of the client. The server can then use the service ticket to access resources on the client's behalf without requiring the client to re-authenticate.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that a user would suddenly no longer have access because of a change in delegation in the second request.",

It provides libraries and command-line tools for developers to integrate HTTP/2 features into their applications, including binary framing, header compression, multiplexing of requests, and server push. `Nghttp2` is widely used in various projects, such as web servers, proxies, and clients.\n\n`HTTP/2` is a binary protocol where the client and server exchange binary frames instead of text lines as in `HTTP/1.x`. `HTTP/2` resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include frame type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload.\n\nThe `HEADERS` frame type allows sending HTTP headers of, both, request and response. The `HEADERS` frame contains many flags.\nThe `CONTINUATION` frame type is similar to the `HEADER` frame, but it has just one flag: `END_HEADERS`. When it is not set, the peer knows that more headers are coming in the following `CONTINUATION` frames.\n\nThis mechanism allows an attacker to send an `HTTP/2` stream with `CONTINUATION` frames, without setting the `END_HEADERS` flag in any of the frames. This can cause denial-of-service when sending an excessive number of these crafted frames due to caching all frames in memory.\n\nThe issue is exploitable by default due to `Nghttp2` being an `HTTP/2`-only implementation.",

          "short_description": "A design problem in the implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol may lead to DoS and ease the possibility of DDoS in web server applications by abusing request cancellation.",
          "full_description": "[The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) is a fundamental protocol of the World Wide Web, enabling the exchange of data between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. It defines the rules for requesting and transmitting web pages and other resources over the internet. Request and response messages are exchanged as a stream of ASCII characters, sent over a reliable transport layer like TCP.\n\n[HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) is a modern network protocol designed to improve the performance and efficiency of web communication. It replaces the older HTTP/1.1 protocol and introduces features like header compression and enhanced request cancellation mechanisms, which collectively enhance the speed and responsiveness of websites.\n\nThis request cancellation mechanism allows clients to terminate unnecessary or redundant requests without waiting for a server's response, reducing network congestion and further improving the overall responsiveness of web applications.\n\nHTTP/2 resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload. The stream ID is essential in clearly associating specific bytes on the network with their corresponding messages, facilitating secure multiplexing and concurrent processing. These streams are bidirectional, enabling clients to transmit frames, and servers to respond with frames using the same ID.\n\nAs detailed in [this technical analysis](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/), there's a vulnerability in the way request cancellation is implemented. The flaw lies in the process of sending an excessive number of requests (specifically, `HEADERS` frames), each immediately followed by a request cancellation frame utilizing the `RST_STREAM` frame. This sequence rapidly leads to a substantial consumption of server-side resources. Consequently, this vulnerability amplifies the risk of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, making it easier to overwhelm and exhaust the server's available resources.\n\nA lot of server applications are vulnerable to the Http/2 Rapid Reset attack.\nHowever, note that HTTP/2 must be enabled, which is not the default configuration on most applications (excluding nghttp2 for example).\nA non-exhaustive list of these vulnerable web applications:\n```\n- Tomcat\n- Jetty\n- NGINX on certain conditions\n- nghttp2\n- Netty\n```",

          "remediation": "##### Deployment mitigations\n\nA possible mitigation is to limit the maximum number of requests that can be made over a single keep-alive connection.\n\n##### Deployment mitigations\n\nFor NGINX:\n\nDisabling HTTP/2 in NGINX is not necessary. Simply ensure you have configured:\n\n- `keepalive_requests` should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests\n- `http2_max_concurrent_streams` should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams\n- `limit_conn` and `limit_req` should be set \"with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security\"\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Nghttp2:\nImplement `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback` callback function, and check and count `RST_STREAM` frames. If an excessive number of `RST_STREAM` frames are received, then take action, such as dropping the connection silently, or calling `nghttp2_submit_goaway` and gracefully terminate the connection.\n```c\n#include \u003cnghttp2/nghttp2.h\u003e\n\n// Callback function for handling frame reception\nint on_frame_recv_callback(nghttp2_session* session,\n                           const nghttp2_frame* frame, void* user_data) {\n    // Check if the received frame is an RST_STREAM frame\n    if (frame-\u003ehd.type == NGHTTP2_RST_STREAM) {\n        // Increment a counter for RST_STREAM frames\n        int* rst_stream_counter = (int*)user_data;\n        (*rst_stream_counter)++;\n        \n        // Define a threshold for excessive RST_STREAM frames\n        int rst_stream_threshold = 10;  // Adjust this value as needed\n        \n        // If the threshold is exceeded, take action (e.g., close the connection)\n        if (*rst_stream_counter \u003e rst_stream_threshold) {\n            // Here, you can choose to close the connection gracefully or drop it\n            // For demonstration purposes, we'll just print a message\n            printf(\"Excessive RST_STREAM frames received. Closing the connection.\\n\");\n            // You can call nghttp2_submit_goaway() to send a GOAWAY frame if needed.\n            // nghttp2_submit_goaway(session, NGHTTP2_FLAG_NONE, error_code, opaque_data);\n            // Then, close the connection.\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Continue processing other frames if needed\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialize nghttp2_session and set up the on_frame_recv_callback\n    nghttp2_session* session;\n    int rst_stream_counter = 0;\n    \n    // Initialize nghttp2_session, set up callbacks, etc.\n    // ...\n\n    // Set the user data to be passed to the callback\n    nghttp2_session_user_data(session, \u0026rst_stream_counter);\n    \n    // Register the on_frame_recv_callback\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks* callbacks;\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks_new(\u0026callbacks);\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks_set_on_frame_recv_callback(callbacks, on_frame_recv_callback);\n    // Other callback registrations here...\n    \n    // Attach the callbacks to the session\n    nghttp2_session_server_new(\u0026session, callbacks, \u0026rst_stream_counter);\n    \n    // Start processing HTTP/2 frames\n    // ...\n\n    // Cleanup and finish the program\n    // ...\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Golang:\n\nThe default stream concurrency limit in `golang` is `250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection`. This value may be adjusted in the `golang.org/x/net/http2` package using the `Server.MaxConcurrentStreams` setting and the `ConfigureServer` function which are available in `golang.org/x/net/http2`.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/net/http2\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Create an HTTP/2 server instance\n\thttp2Server := \u0026http2.Server{}\n\n\t// Set the desired stream concurrency limit\n\tmaxConcurrentStreams := 500 // Change this to your desired limit\n\thttp2Server.MaxConcurrentStreams = uint32(maxConcurrentStreams)\n\n\t// Configure an HTTP server to use HTTP/2 with the adjusted settings\n\tserver := \u0026http.Server{\n\t\tAddr:    \":8080\",\n\t\tHandler: http.HandlerFunc(handleRequest),\n\t}\n\thttp2.ConfigureServer(server, http2Server)\n\n\t// Start the HTTP server\n\terr := server.ListenAndServeTLS(\"cert.pem\", \"key.pem\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor netty:\n```java\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameListener;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameStream;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2ResetFrame;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2HeadersFrame;\n\npublic class CustomHttp2FrameListener implements Http2FrameListener {\n    private int rstFrameCount = 0;\n    private int maxRstFrameCount = 10; // Adjust this to your desired limit\n    private long resetTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    private long resetTimeIntervalMillis = 60000; // 60 seconds\n\n    @Override\n    public int onDataRead(Http2FrameStream stream, byte[] data, int padding, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle data frames if needed\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onRstStreamRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2ResetFrame resetFrame) {\n        long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n        \n        // Check if the reset time interval has passed, and reset the count if needed\n        if (currentTimeMillis - resetTimeMillis \u003e= resetTimeIntervalMillis) {\n            rstFrameCount = 0;\n            resetTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis;\n        }\n        \n        rstFrameCount++;\n        \n        // Check if the count exceeds the limit\n        if (rstFrameCount \u003e maxRstFrameCount) {\n            // Take action, e.g., close the connection, log, or drop frames\n            // You can use stream or resetFrame to get more context if needed.\n            // To close the connection, you can use stream.connection().close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"
