An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet.

This private wildcard matching function would match IDN (International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and could as a result accept patterns that otherwise should mismatch. IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks.

An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read.

In versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4, the function that splits the command arguments into an array improperly uses an `int` to represent the number of entries in the array, allowing a malicious actor to intentionally overflow the return value, leading to arbitrary heap writes. Because the resulting array is then passed to `execv()`, it is possible to leverage this attack to gain remote code execution on a victim machine.

When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source&#39;s `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information on the victim&#39;s machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `git` to version 1:2.34.1-1ubuntu1.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-39253](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-39253)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Nov/1](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Nov/1)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/14/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/14/5)\n- [https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213496](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213496)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2)\n- [https://github.com/ssst0n3/docker-cve-2022-39253-poc](https://github.com/ssst0n3/docker-cve-2022-39253-poc)\n"

These attributes can be defined by adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from the index.

Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim&#39;s filesystem within the malicious repository&#39;s working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.\n\nA fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is impractical, two short-term workarounds are available. Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`. Instead, consider cloning repositories without recursively cloning their submodules, and instead run `git submodule update` at each layer.

As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function&#39;s implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.\n\nThis vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `git` to version 1:2.34.1-1ubuntu1.9 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-25815](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-25815)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2)\n- [https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack](https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack)\n- [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1)\n- [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8)\n- [https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00009.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00009.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/)\n- [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15)\n"

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository&#39;s `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning\nwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `git` to version 1:2.34.1-1ubuntu1.11 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-32021](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-32021)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2)\n- [https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-mvxm-9j2h-qjx7](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-mvxm-9j2h-qjx7)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00009.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00009.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S4CK4IYTXEOBZTEM5K3T6LWOIZ3S44AR/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S4CK4IYTXEOBZTEM5K3T6LWOIZ3S44AR/)\n"

If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user.

When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks.

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

When Git asks for credentials via a terminal prompt (i.e. without using any credential helper), it prints out the host name for which the user is expected to provide a username and/or a password. At this stage, any URL-encoded parts have been decoded already, and are printed verbatim. This allows attackers to craft URLs that contain ANSI escape sequences that the terminal interpret to confuse users e.g. into providing passwords for trusted Git hosting sites when in fact they are then sent to untrusted sites that are under the attacker&#39;s control. This issue has been patch via commits `7725b81` and `c903985` which are included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.2, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3, v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid cloning from untrusted URLs, especially recursive clones.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `git` to version 1:2.34.1-1ubuntu1.12 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-50349](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-50349)\n- [https://github.com/git/git/commit/7725b8100ffbbff2750ee4d61a0fcc1f53a086e8](https://github.com/git/git/commit/7725b8100ffbbff2750ee4d61a0fcc1f53a086e8)\n- [https://github.com/git/git/commit/c903985bf7e772e2d08275c1a95c8a55ab011577](https://github.com/git/git/commit/c903985bf7e772e2d08275c1a95c8a55ab011577)\n- [https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hmg8-h7qf-7cxr](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hmg8-h7qf-7cxr)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/01/msg00025.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/01/msg00025.html)\n"

When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called &#34;sideband channel&#34;. These messages will be prefixed with &#34;remote:&#34; and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `glibc` to version 2.35-0ubuntu3.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-4806](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-4806)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:2413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:2413)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782)\n"

By recovering the secret from the ClientKeyExchange message, the attacker would be able to decrypt the application data exchanged over that connection.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `gnutls28` to version 3.7.3-4ubuntu1.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-0361](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-0361)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UFIA3X4IZ3CW7SRQ2UHNHNPMRIAWF2FI/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UFIA3X4IZ3CW7SRQ2UHNHNPMRIAWF2FI/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WS4KVDOG6QTALWHC2QE4Y7VPDRMLTRWQ/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WS4KVDOG6QTALWHC2QE4Y7VPDRMLTRWQ/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z634YBXAJ5VLDI62IOPBVP5K6YFHAWCY/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z634YBXAJ5VLDI62IOPBVP5K6YFHAWCY/)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-0361](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-0361)\n- [https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/pull/679](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/pull/679)\n- [https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1050](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1050)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/02/msg00015.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/02/msg00015.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UFIA3X4IZ3CW7SRQ2UHNHNPMRIAWF2FI/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UFIA3X4IZ3CW7SRQ2UHNHNPMRIAWF2FI/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WS4KVDOG6QTALWHC2QE4Y7VPDRMLTRWQ/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WS4KVDOG6QTALWHC2QE4Y7VPDRMLTRWQ/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z634YBXAJ5VLDI62IOPBVP5K6YFHAWCY/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z634YBXAJ5VLDI62IOPBVP5K6YFHAWCY/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230324-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230324-0005/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230725-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230725-0005/)\n"

Therefore any error between them calls `goto error` returning SSH_OK.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `libssh` to version 0.9.6-2ubuntu0.22.04.1 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2283](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2283)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/27PD44ALQTZXX7K6JAM3BXBUHYA6DFFN/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/27PD44ALQTZXX7K6JAM3BXBUHYA6DFFN/)\n- [http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172861/libssh-0.9.6-0.10.4-pki_verify_data_signature-Authorization-Bypass.html](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172861/libssh-0.9.6-0.10.4-pki_verify_data_signature-Authorization-Bypass.html)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Feb/18](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Feb/18)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-2283](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-2283)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2189736](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2189736)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/27PD44ALQTZXX7K6JAM3BXBUHYA6DFFN/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/27PD44ALQTZXX7K6JAM3BXBUHYA6DFFN/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-05](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-05)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0005/)\n- [https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-2283.txt](https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-2283.txt)\n"

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH&#39;s use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

The security flaw occurs because the functions in src/InitExt.c in libX11 do not check that the values provided for the Request, Event, or Error IDs are within the bounds of the arrays that those functions write to, using those IDs as array indexes. They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself, possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `libx11` to version 2:1.7.5-1ubuntu0.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-3138](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-3138)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-3138](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-3138)\n- [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/304a654a0d57bf0f00d8998185f0360332cfa36c](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/304a654a0d57bf0f00d8998185f0360332cfa36c)\n- [https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-June/003406.html](https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-June/003406.html)\n- [https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-June/003407.html](https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-June/003407.html)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231208-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231208-0008/)\n"

The nghttp2 library prior to version 1.61.0 keeps reading the unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames even after a stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive CPU usage to decode HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates this vulnerability by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it accepts per stream. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `nghttp2` to version 1.43.0-1ubuntu0.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-28182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-28182)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00041.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00041.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/)\n- [https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644)\n"

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH&#39;s use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

There is a race condition which can lead sshd to handle some signals in an unsafe manner. An unauthenticated, remote attacker may be able to trigger it by failing to authenticate within a set time period.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssh` to version 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.10 or

This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.6 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.5).\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl` to version 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-3358](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-3358)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5485c56679d7c49b96e8fc8ca708b0b7e7c03c4b](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5485c56679d7c49b96e8fc8ca708b0b7e7c03c4b)\n- [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0023](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0023)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221028-0014/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221028-0014/)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221011.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221011.txt)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=5485c56679d7c49b96e8fc8ca708b0b7e7c03c4b](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=5485c56679d7c49b96e8fc8ca708b0b7e7c03c4b)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n"

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO.

This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO.

This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl` to version 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.16 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-40735](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-40735)\n- [https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/](https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/)\n- [https://gist.github.com/c0r0n3r/9455ddcab985c50fd1912eabf26e058b](https://gist.github.com/c0r0n3r/9455ddcab985c50fd1912eabf26e058b)\n- [https://github.com/mozilla/ssl-config-generator/issues/162](https://github.com/mozilla/ssl-config-generator/issues/162)\n- [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374117](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374117)\n- [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-68339-9_29.pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-68339-9_29.pdf)\n- [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf)\n- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVEProject/cvelist/9d7fbbcabd3f44cfedc9e8807757d31ece85a2c6/2022/40xxx/CVE-2022-40735.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVEProject/cvelist/9d7fbbcabd3f44cfedc9e8807757d31ece85a2c6/2022/40xxx/CVE-2022-40735.json)\n- [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Stiglic-2/publication/2401745_Security_Issues_in_the_Diffie-Hellman_Key_Agreement_Protocol/links/546c144f0cf20dedafd53e7e/Security-Issues-in-the-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Agreement-Protocol.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Stiglic-2/publication/2401745_Security_Issues_in_the_Diffie-Hellman_Key_Agreement_Protocol/links/546c144f0cf20dedafd53e7e/Security-Issues-in-the-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Agreement-Protocol.pdf)\n- [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526)\n- [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4419](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4419)\n- [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5114#section-4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5114#section-4)\n- [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7919#section-5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7919#section-5.2)\n"

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with &#39;n&#39; being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer&#39;s certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl` to version 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.10 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2650](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2650)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html)\n- [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt)\n"

A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the &#34;-check&#34; option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl` to version 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.12 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-3817](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-3817)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/43](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/43)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/31/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/31/1)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/11](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/11)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/9](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/9)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/2)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00019.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00019.html)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0014/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0014/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0008/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=6a1eb62c29db6cb5eec707f9338aee00f44e26f5](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=6a1eb62c29db6cb5eec707f9338aee00f44e26f5)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=869ad69aadd985c7b8ca6f4e5dd0eb274c9f3644](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=869ad69aadd985c7b8ca6f4e5dd0eb274c9f3644)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9002fd07327a91f35ba6c1307e71fa6fd4409b7f](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9002fd07327a91f35ba6c1307e71fa6fd4409b7f)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=91ddeba0f2269b017dc06c46c993a788974b1aa5](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=91ddeba0f2269b017dc06c46c993a788974b1aa5)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230731.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230731.txt)\n"

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the &#34;keylen&#34; parameter or the IV length, via the &#34;ivlen&#34; parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST&#39;s SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl` to version 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.12 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-5363](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-5363)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0002/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0002/)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt)\n"

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted.

Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have\nbeen identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\n\nThe first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the\nnetwork and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.\nIn this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only\nbeen partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\n\nThe second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has\nbeen received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of\nthis data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl` to version 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.17 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-4741](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-4741)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/704f725b96aa373ee45ecfb23f6abfe8be8d9177](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/704f725b96aa373ee45ecfb23f6abfe8be8d9177)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b3f0eb0a295f58f16ba43ba99dad70d4ee5c437d](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b3f0eb0a295f58f16ba43ba99dad70d4ee5c437d)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c88c3de51020c37e8706bf7a682a162593053aac](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c88c3de51020c37e8706bf7a682a162593053aac)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e5093133c35ca82874ad83697af76f4b0f7e3bd8](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e5093133c35ca82874ad83697af76f4b0f7e3bd8)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/f7a045f3143fc6da2ee66bf52d8df04829590dd4](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/f7a045f3143fc6da2ee66bf52d8df04829590dd4)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240528.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240528.txt)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0004/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0004/)\n"

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a &#34;no overlap&#34;\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl` to version 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.17 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-5535](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-5535)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0006/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0010/)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt)\n"

This can happen with significant\nprobability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular\nthe NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker\nprocess must either be located in the same physical computer or must\nhave a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason\nthe severity of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl` to version 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.19 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-13176](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-13176)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/07272b05b04836a762b4baa874958af51d513844](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/07272b05b04836a762b4baa874958af51d513844)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2af62e74fb59bc469506bc37eb2990ea408d9467](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2af62e74fb59bc469506bc37eb2990ea408d9467)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/392dcb336405a0c94486aa6655057f59fd3a0902](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/392dcb336405a0c94486aa6655057f59fd3a0902)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4b1cb94a734a7d4ec363ac0a215a25c181e11f65](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4b1cb94a734a7d4ec363ac0a215a25c181e11f65)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/77c608f4c8857e63e98e66444e2e761c9627916f](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/77c608f4c8857e63e98e66444e2e761c9627916f)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/0d5fd1ab987f7571e2c955d8d8b638fc0fb54ded](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/0d5fd1ab987f7571e2c955d8d8b638fc0fb54ded)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/a2639000db19878d5d89586ae7b725080592ae86](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/a2639000db19878d5d89586ae7b725080592ae86)\n- [https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250120.txt](https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250120.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/20/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/20/2)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250124-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250124-0005/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250418-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250418-0010/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00028.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00028.html)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250502-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250502-0006/)\n"

Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added.

This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original&#39;s privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.\n\nA SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner&#39;s permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original&#39;s SUID process coredump file.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file&#39;s name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of &#34;Member name contains &#39;..&#39;&#34; that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain &#34;x -&gt; ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh&#34; and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which &#34;tar xf&#34; is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each &#34;tar xf&#34; in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run &#34;tar xf&#34; more than once into the same directory.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Ubuntu:22.04` `tar`.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2025-45582](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2025-45582)\n- [https://github.com/i900008/vulndb/blob/main/Gnu_tar_vuln.md](https://github.com/i900008/vulndb/blob/main/Gnu_tar_vuln.md)\n- [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)\n- [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2025-08/msg00012.html](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2025-08/msg00012.html)\n- [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Integrity.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Integrity.html)\n- [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Security-rules-of-thumb.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Security-rules-of-thumb.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/01/6](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/01/6)\n"

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing` to version 5.11.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/commit/de1d5a5978b9599ca3dacd58bbf699e4bb4cf6bd)\n"

An attacker can manipulate handshake sequence numbers to delete messages sent immediately after the channel is established.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n1) Sequence numbers are only validated once the channel is established and arbitrary messages are allowed during the handshake, allowing them to manipulate the sequence numbers.\r\n\r\n2) The potential consequences of the general Terrapin attack are dependent on the messages exchanged after the handshake concludes. If you are using a custom SSH service and do not resort to the authentication protocol, you should check that dropping the first few messages of a connection does not yield security risks.\r\n\r\n**Impact:** \r\n\r\nWhile cryptographically novel, there is no discernable impact on the integrity of SSH traffic beyond giving the attacker the ability to delete the message that enables some features related to keystroke timing obfuscation. To successfully carry out the exploitation, the connection needs to be protected using either the `ChaCha20-Poly1305` or `CBC` with `Encrypt-then-MAC` encryption methods.

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack` to version 0.7.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/97fe3a23b68dd2df748f2369827aeab2420e0930)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8e2b117aee74f6b86c207a808b0255de45c0a18a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57855)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E)\n"

An attacker can cause a denial of service (including via DDoS) by rapidly resetting many streams through request cancellation.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/runtime` to version 0.29.0-alpha.3, 1.29.0-alpha.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/commit/58f43670086e530750c7cb74b0bec92bf5189c79)\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/pgjones/hypercorn/commit/7c39c68b61012a3c30979176080861c8b00fb229)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/commit/1f29fe6a8567c57dfe848a21ae883304cce5646d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/76bb4bfbfeae827dce896f650655bbf6e251ed49)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/9cdfe25bad707f34b3e5da2994f3f1952a163c3e)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/dbb94514dc9d3fb21fe92080f57c314e7e06a148)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/commit/15f34f927a45130408eb16ed09af5620270d4d1f)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/28fe15117b909588bf14269a0e1c6ec4548579fe)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/commit/be9188050914374ee8128239e5a2e5998d7897f5)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/58f75f665aa81a8cbcf6ffa74820042a285c5e61)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/72b4af6143681f528f1d237b21a9a7aee1738832)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/commit/9ec03f07f942dc9cef736957fa152e39157d6e13)\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/find-fix-http-2-rapid-reset-zero-day-vulnerability-cve-2023-44487/)\n- [Vulnerability Discovery](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/)\n- [Vulnerability Explanation](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-it-works-the-novel-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack)\n- [CISA - Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n- [PoC in GitHub](https://github.com/studiogangster/CVE-2023-44487)\n- [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52426)\n"

By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin` to version 0.2.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/commit/c121231e1276e11049547bee5ce68d5a2cfe2d9b)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/pull/9)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/releases/tag/v0.2.4)\n"
