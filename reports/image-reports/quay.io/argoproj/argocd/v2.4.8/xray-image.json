It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.\n\n`BIO_new_NDEF` is a helper function in OpenSSL that is used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. NDEF stands for `Nested ASN.1 Data Encoding Format`. Specifically, it pre-pends a new `BIO_f_asn1` filter BIO onto the front of a given BIO chain and returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. This function is primarily used internally in OpenSSL to support the streaming capabilities of the SMIME, CMS, and PKCS7 protocols, but it may also be called directly by end-user applications.\n\nAn issue has been detected in the `BIO_new_NDEF` function. If the new filter BIO created by the function is freed due to a failure, such as an invalid CMS recipient public key, the input BIO that was passed to `BIO_new_NDEF` is still pointing to the freed filter BIO. If the caller then calls the `BIO_pop()` function on the input BIO, a use-after-free will occur, which can result in a crash or other unpredictable behavior. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) by crafting a malicious input that triggers the use-after-free condition.\n\nCalling any of the following functions with external data may trigger this issue -\n```\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream\nPEM_write_bio_CMS_stream\nPEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream\nSMIME_write_ASN1\nSMIME_write_CMS\nSMIME_write_PKCS7\nBIO_new_CMS\nBIO_new_PKCS7\ni2d_CMS_bio_stream\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream\nBIO_new_NDEF\n```",

A typical use of a PKCS #7 file would be to store certificates.\n\nIt was discovered that when verifying `PKCS7` certificate signatures, a NULL dereference may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\nThe issue is in the `pkcs7_bio_add_digest()` and `PKCS7_dataDecode()` functions.\nThey both call the `BIO_set_md()` function which initializes the hash algorithm (by calling the `EVP_DigestInit()` function)- without checking for its return value.\n\nThe digest initialization will fail In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available.\n\nSubsequent calls to the `BIO_write()` and `BIO_read()` functions will later use this invalid digest initialization, which will lead to a NULL dereference.\n\nThe unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using a configuration that uses the `FIPS` module of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider.\n\nThis issue can be triggered for example by an attacker providing `PKCS7` data digested with `MD4` if the legacy provider is not loaded.\n\n`PKCS7` data is processed by the S/MIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls, which also means the `smime` command-line tool is vulnerable.\nThe `smime` tool handles S/MIME mail. It can encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify S/MIME messages.\n\nThis vulnerability may affect third-party applications that call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data.\nHowever, the TLS implementation of OpenSSL is not affected due to it not calling these functions.",

These sub-identifiers form a hierarchical structure, allowing for the unique identification of objects, algorithms, or protocols. For example, the OID \"1.2.840.10045.2.1\" represents the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in decimal form.\n\nThe function `OBJ_obj2txt()` in OpenSSL allows the translation of an `ASN.1 Object Identifier` into its canonical numeric text form. This canonical form represents the sub-identifiers of the Object Identifier in decimal form, with each sub-identifier separated by periods.\n\nAn issue in this function has been discovered: the number of sub-identifiers is not limited. As the computing time of the translation is quadratic, an attacker-controlled Object identifier can craft a large one with a big sub-identifier and may cause a denial of service.\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.x, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names/identifiers in a String form was introduced. This includes using Object Identifiers in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms.\n\nFor OpenSSL 3.x, `OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF, or TS` are vulnerable but not `TLS` (100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain) except if it has `client_authentication` enabled.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n```c\n    basic_resp = d2i_OCSP_BASICRESP_bio(bio, NULL);\n    if (!basic_resp) {\n        printf(\"Error parsing OCSP response\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Load the certificate to verify against\n    cert = X509_new();\n    if (!cert) {\n        printf(\"Error creating X509 certificate object\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    if (!X509_load_cert_file(cert, \"certificate.pem\")) {\n        printf(\"Error loading certificate\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Verify the OCSP response\n    int status = OCSP_basic_verify(basic_resp, cert, NULL, 0);\n    if (status == 1) {\n        printf(\"OCSP response is valid\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"OCSP response verification failed\\n\");\n    }\n```\nThe function `OCSP_basic_verify()` is calling indirectly the vulnerable `OBJ_obj2txt()` function and is processing an external response that can be used by an attacker to trigger the issue.",

        "summary": "OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.6 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.5).",

Ubuntu 22.04 and RHEL 9)\n\nA list of 3rd-party software that uses OpenSSL 3.x [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7ih8XJ5LHq-30saNCS9S7pJafe37S1b6ZRxWXcnx6HbrHFFTNIk7-gFQ7_NJlET47w0naS8deLtIG/pubhtml#)\n\nIt was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow can be triggered when a crafted TLS certificate is being verified by an OpenSSL TLS client or server. Since the bug occurs after certificate verification, the crafted TLS certificate must have a valid signature.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited whenever a certificate is verified. The most likely exploitation vectors are -\n1. TLS Server - if the OpenSSL 3.x-enabled TLS server accepts client certificates (TLS client authentication) which is usually a non-default option. For example a vulnerable Node.js TLS server would need to be set up with the `requestCert` option -\n\n```js\nvar https = require('https');\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\nvar options = {\n  key:    fs.readFileSync('/etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key'),\n  cert:   fs.readFileSync('/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt'),\n\n// Enable client certificate authentication!\n  requestCert: true,\n...\nhttps.createServer(options, ...\n```\n\n2. TLS Client - if the OpenSSL 3.x-enabled TLS client accesses a malicious TLS server, for example if a browser follows a link to a malicious website via a Phishing attack.\n\nCVE-2022-3786 leads to an arbitrary length overflow of a constant character ('.'). Since the attacker does not control the overflowed data, the issue can only be exploited for denial of service (and not remote code execution).\n\nCurrently it seems that the biggest real-world danger from this issue is DoS on TLS servers that enable TLS client authentication via certificates.",

Ubuntu 22.04 and RHEL 9)\n\nA list of 3rd-party software that uses OpenSSL 3.x [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7ih8XJ5LHq-30saNCS9S7pJafe37S1b6ZRxWXcnx6HbrHFFTNIk7-gFQ7_NJlET47w0naS8deLtIG/pubhtml#)\n\nIt was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow can be triggered when a crafted TLS certificate is being verified by an OpenSSL TLS client or server. Since the bug occurs after certificate verification, the crafted TLS certificate must have a valid signature.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited whenever a certificate is verified. The most likely exploitation vectors are -\n1. TLS Server - if the OpenSSL 3.x-enabled TLS server accepts client certificates (TLS client authentication) which is usually a non-default option. For example a vulnerable Node.js TLS server would need to be set up with the `requestCert` option -\n\n```js\nvar https = require('https');\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\nvar options = {\n  key:    fs.readFileSync('/etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key'),\n  cert:   fs.readFileSync('/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt'),\n\n// Enable client certificate authentication!\n  requestCert: true,\n...\nhttps.createServer(options, ...\n```\n\n2. TLS Client - if the OpenSSL 3.x-enabled TLS client accesses a malicious TLS server, for example if a browser follows a link to a malicious website via a Phishing attack.\n\nCVE-2022-3602 leads to a 4-byte stack buffer overflow, which is nontrivial to exploit for remote code execution for the following reasons -\n1. The OpenSSL maintainers reported that feedback from testing (of various vendors) showed that the stack layout in common platforms does not allow a 4-byte overflow to overwrite any critical variable that may lead to remote code execution\n\n2. Since OpenSSL 3.x is a new version, any system that runs it, is also likely to have Stack-buffer-overflow mitigations enabled, such as ASLR, StackGuard and more. Therefore, RCE would only be achieved if the attackers discover an additional 0-day infoleak vulnerability that allows bypassing these mitigations\n\nCurrently it seems that the biggest real-world danger from this issue is DoS on TLS servers that enable TLS client authentication via certificates.",

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are...",

This can be used for a known-plaintext attack, where an adversary possesses both the plaintext and its corresponding encrypted form, aiming to deduce the encryption key or gain insights into the encryption algorithm.\n\nTo counter this, we use an Initialization vector (IV), which is a random or unique input to a cryptographic algorithm used to alter the first block of the cipher, ensuring equal plaintext blocks won’t be transformed to equal ciphertexts.\n\nA vulnerability was found in OpenSSL 3.x, in certain situations, parameters such as key length or IV length, will be processed after the key and IV have been established, hence they will not take effect as intended, potentially causing truncation or overreading of these values, impacting the confidentiality of the encryption.\n\nWhen calling the functions `EVP_CipherInit_ex2`, `EVP_EncryptInit_ex2, or `EVP_DecryptInit_ex2` with an `OSSL_PARAM` array, changes to the `keylen` or `ivlen` parameters will only be processed after the IV and the key have been established.\n\nNote this impacts the following ciphers: RC2, RC4, RC5, and the following cipher modes: CCM, GCM, OCB.",

Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable\napplication is low.\n\nIn particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,\nso problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509\ncertificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\"\ncurve encoding.\n\nThe affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),\nand various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.\n\nApplications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,\nthat make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero\nconstant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a\nresult of reading or writing outside of array bounds.

          "full_description": "[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is a software library for applications that provide secure communications over computer networks.

Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",

So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity\nof the issue is Moderate.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",

It's commonly used in Unix-like systems to scroll through logs, documentation, and other text output without editing the file.\n\nA flaw in the way Less handles filenames may lead to code execution due to incorrect parsing of filenames with newline characters.\nw\nWhen less constructs a shell command (often via the LESSOPEN preprocessor wrapper), it does not properly quote filenames. An attacker can craft a malicious filename with embedded newlines plus additional shell commands. When the LESSOPEN mechanism processes the filename, those commands are unintentionally executed.\n\nTo successfully exploit this CVE the `LESSOPEN` environment variable must be set, which is the default cases in many Linux distributions.",

          "full_description": "[The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) is a fundamental protocol of the World Wide Web, enabling the exchange of data between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. It defines the rules for requesting and transmitting web pages and other resources over the internet. Request and response messages are exchanged as a stream of ASCII characters, sent over a reliable transport layer like TCP.\n\n[HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) is a modern network protocol designed to improve the performance and efficiency of web communication. It replaces the older HTTP/1.1 protocol and introduces features like header compression and enhanced request cancellation mechanisms, which collectively enhance the speed and responsiveness of websites.\n\nThis request cancellation mechanism allows clients to terminate unnecessary or redundant requests without waiting for a server's response, reducing network congestion and further improving the overall responsiveness of web applications.\n\nHTTP/2 resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload. The stream ID is essential in clearly associating specific bytes on the network with their corresponding messages, facilitating secure multiplexing and concurrent processing. These streams are bidirectional, enabling clients to transmit frames, and servers to respond with frames using the same ID.\n\nAs detailed in [this technical analysis](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/), there's a vulnerability in the way request cancellation is implemented. The flaw lies in the process of sending an excessive number of requests (specifically, `HEADERS` frames), each immediately followed by a request cancellation frame utilizing the `RST_STREAM` frame. This sequence rapidly leads to a substantial consumption of server-side resources. Consequently, this vulnerability amplifies the risk of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, making it easier to overwhelm and exhaust the server's available resources.\n\nA lot of server applications are vulnerable to the Http/2 Rapid Reset attack.\nHowever, note that HTTP/2 must be enabled, which is not the default configuration on most applications (excluding nghttp2 for example).\nA non-exhaustive list of these vulnerable web applications:\n```\n- Tomcat\n- Jetty\n- NGINX on certain conditions\n- nghttp2\n- Netty\n```",

          "remediation": "##### Deployment mitigations\n\nA possible mitigation is to limit the maximum number of requests that can be made over a single keep-alive connection.\n\n##### Deployment mitigations\n\nFor NGINX:\n\nDisabling HTTP/2 in NGINX is not necessary. Simply ensure you have configured:\n\n- `keepalive_requests` should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests\n- `http2_max_concurrent_streams` should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams\n- `limit_conn` and `limit_req` should be set \"with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security\"\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Nghttp2:\nImplement `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback` callback function, and check and count `RST_STREAM` frames. If an excessive number of `RST_STREAM` frames are received, then take action, such as dropping the connection silently, or calling `nghttp2_submit_goaway` and gracefully terminate the connection.\n```c\n#include \u003cnghttp2/nghttp2.h\u003e\n\n// Callback function for handling frame reception\nint on_frame_recv_callback(nghttp2_session* session,\n                           const nghttp2_frame* frame, void* user_data) {\n    // Check if the received frame is an RST_STREAM frame\n    if (frame-\u003ehd.type == NGHTTP2_RST_STREAM) {\n        // Increment a counter for RST_STREAM frames\n        int* rst_stream_counter = (int*)user_data;\n        (*rst_stream_counter)++;\n        \n        // Define a threshold for excessive RST_STREAM frames\n        int rst_stream_threshold = 10;  // Adjust this value as needed\n        \n        // If the threshold is exceeded, take action (e.g., close the connection)\n        if (*rst_stream_counter \u003e rst_stream_threshold) {\n            // Here, you can choose to close the connection gracefully or drop it\n            // For demonstration purposes, we'll just print a message\n            printf(\"Excessive RST_STREAM frames received.

This value may be adjusted in the `golang.org/x/net/http2` package using the `Server.MaxConcurrentStreams` setting and the `ConfigureServer` function which are available in `golang.org/x/net/http2`.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/net/http2\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Create an HTTP/2 server instance\n\thttp2Server := \u0026http2.Server{}\n\n\t// Set the desired stream concurrency limit\n\tmaxConcurrentStreams := 500 // Change this to your desired limit\n\thttp2Server.MaxConcurrentStreams = uint32(maxConcurrentStreams)\n\n\t// Configure an HTTP server to use HTTP/2 with the adjusted settings\n\tserver := \u0026http.Server{\n\t\tAddr:    \":8080\",\n\t\tHandler: http.HandlerFunc(handleRequest),\n\t}\n\thttp2.ConfigureServer(server, http2Server)\n\n\t// Start the HTTP server\n\terr := server.ListenAndServeTLS(\"cert.pem\", \"key.pem\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor netty:\n```java\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameListener;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameStream;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2ResetFrame;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2HeadersFrame;\n\npublic class CustomHttp2FrameListener implements Http2FrameListener {\n    private int rstFrameCount = 0;\n    private int maxRstFrameCount = 10; // Adjust this to your desired limit\n    private long resetTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    private long resetTimeIntervalMillis = 60000; // 60 seconds\n\n    @Override\n    public int onDataRead(Http2FrameStream stream, byte[] data, int padding, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle data frames if needed\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onRstStreamRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2ResetFrame resetFrame) {\n        long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n        \n        // Check if the reset time interval has passed, and reset the count if needed\n        if (currentTimeMillis - resetTimeMillis \u003e= resetTimeIntervalMillis) {\n            rstFrameCount = 0;\n            resetTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis;\n        }\n        \n        rstFrameCount++;\n        \n        // Check if the count exceeds the limit\n        if (rstFrameCount \u003e maxRstFrameCount) {\n            // Take action, e.g., close the connection, log, or drop frames\n            // You can use stream or resetFrame to get more context if needed.\n            // To close the connection, you can use stream.connection().close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"

It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.\n\nGo offers multiple built-in packages. One of them is [PEM package](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/pem), responsible for encoding and decoding PEM data like TLS keys or certificates. \n\nThe PEM's data decoding can be compromised to cause a stack overflow/exhaustion and thus, a denial of service. The bug was proven to be triggered when decoding a large PEM data containing errors. Errors were triggering a recursive call the `Decode` function itself. Recursive calls fill up the calling stack until the crash. \n\nThe bug was fixed in Go version 1.18.1 and 1.17.9. A proof-of-concept was [published](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/399820/1/src/encoding/pem/pem_test.go#164) as a test case.",

          "short_description": "A design problem in Golang's go command leads to arbitrary code execution when building crafted Go source code.",
          "full_description": "Compiler directives are statements written in the source code that give the programmer the ability to control the compiler's behavior. Golang compiler accepts compiler directives as comments (using `//` single line and `/*` multi-line comments). \n\nA [line directive](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-Compiler_Directives) specifies the source position for the character immediately following the comment as having come from the specified file. The following example specifies that the filename is foo.go and the line number is 10 for the next line in the source code.\n\n`//line foo.go:10` \n\nThe `cgo` package lets Go packages call C code and combines c files and go files into a single Go package. The cgo directives are used to provide flags for the compiler and linker when building the C parts of the package. For security reasons (may lead to code execution), the Golang command restricts the use of `cgo` directives (`//go:cgo_`) unless the file is generated by cgo.\n\nThe Golang compiler has a design problem in the implementation of the `isCgoGeneratedFile()` function, which leads to cgo directives restrictions being bypassed when handling crafted line directives followed by cgo directives. This function's purpose is to determine whether a file was generated by cgo or not, tricking this function is the key to bypassing the compiler restrictions. The following combination tricks the compiler into handling cgo directives as it is part of cgo-generated code (`_cgo_` prefix) although it is not.\n\n```\n//line /tmp/_cgo_.go:1\n//go:cgo_dynamic_linker \"/elf/interp\"\n```\n\nUsing the directives above tricks the compiler to use restricted cgo directives, which can lead to arbitrary code execution when running the `go build` command on the manipulated source code.\n\nThe line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which can make exploiting this issue more complex (may require per-target research).\n\nThe official fix solves this issue by correcting the implementation of the `isCgoGeneratedFile()` function to find the real position of a statement (not the position specified by the line directive).",

For example, calling `Clean(\"a/../c:/b\")` will erroneously transform the input path into `c:\\b`.

It is primarily used for managing Go modules, which are collections of Go packages and their dependencies.\nThe logic in `(*modfetch).codeRepo.Stat` function, part of the `cmd/go` package, has a short-circuit when processing a branch name that resembles a version tag (such as `v1.0.0` or `subdir/v2.0.0-dev`).\nIn that issue, the concern raised was that the vulnerability allowed branches with names resembling version tags to be treated as valid versions by the `go` command, potentially bypassing the existing ACLs. This means that even if an organization had restrictions on creating version tags, a branch named `v1.0.0` or similar could still be mistakenly recognized as a valid version by Go.\n\nFor example, if a system contains a branch named `v1.0.1` and a corresponding tag is missing for that specific version, running the command `go get [...]@v1.0.1` would fetch the branch instead of a version tag.",

        "summary": "A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary ...",

          "full_description": "The `net/http` and `mime/multipart` packages in Go are used for handling HTTP requests and responses, and for parsing multipart/form-data requests, respectively.\nWhen handling HTTP requests that contain multipart form data, the Go programming language provides two packages: `mime/multipart` and `net/http`. Multipart form data can be parsed using the `mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm` function, as well as the Request methods `FormFile`, `FormValue`, `ParseMultipartForm`, and `PostFormValue` provided by the `net/http` package.\n\nBy default, the maximum amount of memory that can be used for buffering is set to `maxMemory` bytes + 10MB. However, there was an issue where certain metadata such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers were not included in the memory size calculation. This could allow an attacker that controls the metadata's length to create excessively large files that could potentially exhaust the available disk space and cause a denial of service.\n\nVulnerable code example -\n```go\n// forms.go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"html/template\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\ntype ContactDetails struct {\n    Email   string\n    Subject string\n    Message string\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    tmpl := template.Must(template.ParseFiles(\"forms.html\"))\n\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        if r.Method != http.MethodPost {\n            tmpl.Execute(w, nil)\n            return\n        }\n\n        details := ContactDetails{\n            Email:   r.FormValue(\"email\"),\n            Subject: r.FormValue(\"subject\"),\n            Message: r.FormValue(\"message\"),\n        }\n\n        // do something with details\n        _ = details\n\n        tmpl.Execute(w, struct{ Success bool }{true})\n    })\n\n    http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil)\n}\n```",

It is a standard package included in the Go standard library and is widely used in the development of secure applications that rely on elliptic curve cryptography.\n`Curve.IsOnCurve()` is a method provided by the `crypto/elliptic` Go package, which is used to verify that a given point is on a specific elliptic curve. This method plays a critical role in ensuring the accuracy of points used in various cryptographic operations, including digital signatures and key exchange.\n\nThe `crypto/elliptic` library implements elliptic curves on finite fields with prime orders. In this context, the coordinates used are elements of a field that consists of integers ranging from zero to P-1, where P is a prime number. It's important to note that coordinates below zero (negative) or equal to or greater than P (overflowing) are not valid coordinates.\n\nWhen invalid integer inputs, such as negative or overflowing big integers are passed to `Curve.IsOnCurve()`, it may incorrectly return `true` instead of `false`. To avoid passing invalid inputs, it is a standard practice to validate field elements using `Curve.IsOnCurve()` before using them in other functions. This is because the `Curve.IsOnCurve()` function's false return value is critical for the correct execution of the `ScalarMult()` and `Marshal()` functions.\n\nFailing to validate the field elements may cause these functions to panic due to inaccurate results.",

Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access. In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory (the root of the current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape from the drive and access any path on the system. With fix applied, the behavior of os.DirFS(\"\") has changed. Previously, an empty root was treated equivalently to \"/\", so os.DirFS(\"\").Open(\"tmp\") would open the path \"/tmp\". This now returns an error.",

          "full_description": "Golang's [net/http/httputil](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil) package provides HTTP utility functions, complementing the ones in Golang's net/http package.\n\nGolang's [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) package provides HTTP client and server implementations in Golang.\n\nGolang's [net/url](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url) package is used for parsing URLs and query escaping.\n\nIn Go 1.17, URL parsing was changed to reject keys containing a semicolon. But despite the function `net/url.ParseQuery` being changed to raise an error when given a parameter with `;`, the function `net/url.URL.Query`, which calls the `net/url.ParseQuery`, ignores any error returned by it. Furthermore, the function `net/http/httputils.NewSingleHostReverseProxy` does not parse the query at all and sends the raw query to the backend.\n\nThis means that when there's a version discrepancy between the frontend and the backend - where the frontend uses a Go 1.17 or later, and the backend uses Go 1.16.x or earlier - it is possible for attackers to use parameter smuggling in order to bypass possible filters.\n\nTake for example the fictional website `https://mysite`, which uses Go 1.18 for its frontend and Go 1.16 for its backend. When going to `https://mysite/home`, the user's name is added as a parameter, e.g.  `https://mysite/home?name=sam`. In addition to the `name` parameter, it is possible to add a `role` parameter, which can be set to either `user` or `admin`. When the parameter is set to `admin` the frontend checks whether the user's name is that of an admin or not before forwarding the query to the backend.\n\nHowever,  when an attacker sends a request such as `https://mysite/home?role=admin;\u0026name=regularuser`, and the frontend parses it using `net/url.URL.Query`, the function will only return the `name=regularuser` parameter and raise no error. Since the frontend deems the request valid, it will pass it to the backend using `net/http/httputils.NewSingleHostReverseProxy`, which will pass the raw query instead of the parsed query from `net/url.URL.Query` to the backend. When the backend parses the query, both `name=regularuser` and `role=admin` will be returned. Thus, the attacker bypassed the frontend's filter.\n\nThe vulnerability does not exist if the frontend and the backend both use Go before 1.17 or Go after 1.17.",

In this case, the `SetString` method does not filter or limit the overflow of the exponent value when the exponent is negative. Consequently, it is converted to an unsigned integer, which can trigger a sizeable exponential operation during the conversion process.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n```go\nfunc ParseFloatStringToRat(floatStr string) (*big.Rat, error) {\n\tr := big.NewRat(1, 1)\n\tif _, ok := r.SetString(floatStr); !ok {\n\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to parse the string!\")\n\t}\n\n\treturn r, nil\n}\n```",

The `Decoder` object also supports skipping over XML elements (including their nested children) by calling the `Skip` method recursively.\n\nIt was discovered that when given a deeply nested XML document, the `(*Decoder).Skip` method will recurse many times, which may lead to stack exhaustion. This could cause the calling Golang process to crash.\n\nThe issue was fixed by replacing the recursion portion of the function with a depth counter. The depth counter will increase for each new start token, and while the depth counter is not 0, will decrease for each new end token.\n\nWhile `(*Decoder).Skip` may not be used directly, it is called by the widely used `(*Decoder).Decode`, `(*Decoder).DecodeElement` and `Unmarshal` functions.\n\nExample code snippets that are vulnerable to this issue -\n```go\ndecoder := xml.NewDecoder(attacker_input)\nerr := decoder.Skip()\n```\n\n```go\nerr := xml.Unmarshal(attacker_input, result_object)\n```\n\nThe vulnerable behavior can be exploited by attackers to cause denial of service, by providing crafted, deeply nested XML documents to one of the following API functions (from `encoding/xml`):\n\n1. `(*Decoder).Skip`\n2. `(*Decoder).Decode`\n3. `(*Decoder).DecodeElement`\n4. `Unmarshal`",

This package takes into consideration the operating system.\nThe `Clean()` function in the  `path/filepath` package is used to clean up a given path and return a shorter, cleaned version of the path. \nOn Windows, a path beginning with \\??\\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with \\\\?\\. Paths with a \\??\\ prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system.\n\nIt was discovered that when running Go applications on Windows, the `path/filepath` package does not recognize paths with a \\??\\ prefix as special. For example, the path \\??\\c:\\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\\x. Before fixing, `Clean()` could convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into the root local device path \\??\\b. The vulnerability affects most of the functions of the `path/filepath` package, not just `Clean()`, this could lead to unexpected results when relying on the package, including path traversal which may lead to arbitrary file-read/file-write.",

        "summary": "Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.",

With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes is restricted to \u003c= 8192 bits. Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.",

The reverse proxy allows bare `LF` characters and doesn't interpret them as line terminators.\n\n2. The backend server allows bare `LF` characters and interprets them as line terminators.\n\nWith the above configuration, HTTP requests reach the backend server, where they are split due to the interpretation of the bare LF as a line terminator. Thus, the smuggled request is processed as an additional individual request.\n\nFor the backend server, there are such servers, for example, `Nginx` or anything that uses Go's `net/http`,  which is unpatched to this vuln (after this patch, Go's `net/http` completely rejects bare LF).\n\nHowever, for reverse proxy, there is no such known proxy (including `Nginx`, `Traefik`). Most known proxies either disallow Bare LF or treat it as a line terminator.\n\nHTTP Request Smuggling is a web security vulnerability where conflicting interpretations of HTTP specifications by different front-end and back-end servers can lead to request manipulation by attackers.\nThis type of attack can lead to the following impacts: DoS, SSRF, XXS, data leakage, cache poisoning, session manipulation, security bypass, and business logic abuse.",

          "full_description": "`net/textproto` is a Go standard library package that offers functionality for parsing and serializing textual protocols used in network communications, such as HTTP, SMTP, NNTP, and FTP, by providing methods for reading and writing lines, headers, and MIME-style messages in a way that handles common protocol-specific quirks and variations.\nA vulnerability was identified in the `ReadMIMEHeader()` function within the `net/textproto` package, whereby certain input data patterns (large amounts of LF characters) can cause the function to allocate an excessive amount of memory. For instance, a header with a large number of newline characters may cause the function to over-allocate memory, resulting in memory exhaustion and a denial of service. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by crafting small requests, making it a relatively easy target for malicious activity.\n\nThis issue is dangerous since even a very simple Go HTTP server is remotely vulnerable to DoS.\n\nVulnerable code example -\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc hello(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n    fmt.Fprintf(w, \"hello\\n\")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/hello\", hello)\n    http.ListenAndServe(\":80\", nil)\n}\n```",

        "summary": "Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.",

        "summary": "An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.",

          "full_description": "The `net/http` package in Go is used for handling HTTP requests and responses.\n`HTTP/2` is a binary protocol where the client and server exchange binary frames instead of text lines as in `HTTP/1.x`. `HTTP/2` resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include frame type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload.\n\nThe `HEADERS` frame type allows sending HTTP headers of, both, request and response. The `HEADERS` frame contains many flags.\nThe `CONTINUATION` frame type is similar to the `HEADER` frame, but it has just one flag: `END_HEADERS`. When it is not set, the peer knows that more headers are coming in the following `CONTINUATION` frames.\n\nThis mechanism allows an attacker to send an `HTTP/2` stream with `CONTINUATION` frames, without setting the `END_HEADERS` flag in any of the frames. This can cause denial-of-service when sending an excessive number of these crafted frames due to caching all frames in memory.\n\nThough the `net/http` package uses HTTP/2 by default, a Golang web server must have HTTPS configured to be vulnerable to exploitation.\nThe `x/net/http2` package is vulnerable by default.",

An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending \"Expect: 100-continue\" requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend.

It is a standard package included in the Go standard library and is widely used in the development of secure applications that rely on elliptic curve cryptography.\nThe P256 elliptic curve is utilized in cryptographic protocols, specifically in the widespread deployment of the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signature scheme.\nIn elliptic curve cryptography, a scalar refers to a non-negative integer used for scalar multiplication with a point on the curve.\n\nA flaw discovered in this P256 elliptic curve can cause the application to panic and may lead to a denial of service.\nIf the input scalar is strictly longer than 32 bytes, the `P256().ScalarMult` or `P256().ScalarBaseMult` functions may perform an out-of-bound write, thus causing a Golang panic.\n\nNote: Indirect uses through `crypto/ecdsa` and `crypto/tls` are unaffected. `amd64`, `arm64`, `ppc64le` and `s390x` platforms are also unaffected.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n```\nfunc VulnExample(c elliptic.Curve, px *big.Int, py *big.Int) (int, error) {\n\th.ax, h.ay = c.ScalarBaseMult(h.s.Bytes())\n\ttx, ty := c.ScalarMult(px, py, h.s.Bytes())\n\th.bx, h.by = c.Add(tx, ty, c.Params().Gx, c.Params().Gy)\n\treturn DiscreteLog(h.bx, h,by, c, 1\u003c\u003c10)\n```",

It provides libraries and command-line tools for developers to integrate HTTP/2 features into their applications, including binary framing, header compression, multiplexing of requests, and server push. `Nghttp2` is widely used in various projects, such as web servers, proxies, and clients.\n\n`HTTP/2` is a binary protocol where the client and server exchange binary frames instead of text lines as in `HTTP/1.x`. `HTTP/2` resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include frame type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload.\n\nThe `HEADERS` frame type allows sending HTTP headers of, both, request and response. The `HEADERS` frame contains many flags.\nThe `CONTINUATION` frame type is similar to the `HEADER` frame, but it has just one flag: `END_HEADERS`. When it is not set, the peer knows that more headers are coming in the following `CONTINUATION` frames.\n\nThis mechanism allows an attacker to send an `HTTP/2` stream with `CONTINUATION` frames, without setting the `END_HEADERS` flag in any of the frames. This can cause denial-of-service when sending an excessive number of these crafted frames due to caching all frames in memory.\n\nThe issue is exploitable by default due to `Nghttp2` being an `HTTP/2`-only implementation.",

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",

It was derived from the earlier experimental `SPDY` protocol, originally developed by Google.\n\nA client starts an `HTTP/1.1` connection and sends an `Upgrade: h2c` header. If the server supports `HTTP/2`, it replies with `HTTP 101 Switching Protocol` status code.\n\nThe `h2c` package handled this request by handing off the request to the `HTTP/2` server.\n\nIt was discovered that when the request body is not fully-read, the partially-read request would be handed-off to the `HTTP/2` server. This could result in a [request smuggling attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling), where a request can be treated by a server as 2 separate requests, giving an attacker the ability to create arbitrary requests.\n\nNote that the issue only occurs when limiting the size of the initial `HTTP/1.1` request body with a `MaxBytesHandler`.",

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",

Null characters are separators between fields in BSON, which allows to break state and control the content of the file.  \n\nFrom an attacker's point of view, in order to exploit the vulnerability, a Go object which will be marshalled to a BSON file using `BSONValueWriter` needs to be manipulated. Specifically, either key name, regex pattern or regex options strings need to contain a null byte, after which a valid BSON structure needs to appear, encoding the additional fields which will be written to the output file.

A notable issue emerges when a GLIBC_TUNABLES variable adopts the format \"tunable1=tunable2=AAA\", and both \"tunable1\" and \"tunable2\" are SXID_IGNORE tunables. This particular scenario can lead to a buffer overflow in the copied GLIBC_TUNABLES variable. Utilizing this buffer overflow vulnerability, an attacker gains the ability to overwrite the pointer that directs the dynamic loader to its library search path. This pointer is critical in determining where the dynamic loader locates essential libraries. By manipulating this pointer, the attacker redirects the dynamic loader to load a malicious libc.so library situated in a location controlled by them. This malicious library may execute harmful code, ultimately facilitating an escalation of privileges.",

It is a toolkit for developing \"GUI-like\" application software that runs under a terminal emulator.\n\nThe `convert_strings` function in the `terminfo` module of `ncurses` is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, leading to memory leakage. The bug is triggerable by means of the `/progs/tic` tool that ships with ncurses and compiles a terminfo source. An example of running the tic tool - \n```\n/progs/tic -o /path/to/output/directory/ \u003cTIC_SOURCE_FILEPATH\u003e\n```\nThe vulnerability can be triggered when the attacker controls the contents of the TIC_SOURCE file.\n\nThe [PoC](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2022-04/msg00014.html) published is a terminfo file with special characters and Unicode characters leading to a memory leakage and a crash when reading a bad address. It is hardly usable by an attacker as the leaked memory either causes a crash - and so the data leaked is not obtainable - or written to a local output file, which doesn't benefit remote attackers.",

          "full_description": "ncurses is a programming library that allows developers to create text-based user interfaces in a terminal or console window. It provides functions for controlling the cursor, displaying text and graphics, and handling user input, and is widely used in Unix-like operating systems for building cross-platform command-line applications.\nThe `terminfo` file is a database that stores information about terminal types and their capabilities.  By default, ncurses will search `${HOME}/.terminfo` first, then `/etc/terminfo`, then `/lib/terminfo`, and\n finally `/usr/share/terminfo`.\n\nTerminfo allows to declare user definable attributes, custom numbers or strings thatextend its standard capabilities.\nUsers can customize their own terminfo definitions by creating or modifying files within their `.terminfo`. \nThe `.terminfo` directory is typically located at `$HOME/.terminfo`, and users have the necessary privileges to modify the files within this directory. The default location can be overwritten by defining the `$TERMINFO` or `$TERM` environment variable.\nExample: `export TERMINFO=/my/terminfo/db/path`\n\nAn issue was discovered in the ncurses library's `_nc_read_termtype` function, responsible for parsing terminfo database file due to improper handling of heap allocation for `Strings` and `Extended Strings` within the `terminfo` file. The function fails to handle the allocation correctly, leading to a heap buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption issues.\nDue to the nature of the vulnerability, an attacker would mainly try to get local privilege escalation. Then, the only binaries that are vulnerable to this issue are the `SetUID binaries` that are using `ncurses`. \n \nThe exposed functions that call the `_nc_read_termtype` function are: `_nc_read_file_entry`, `initscr`, `setupterm` and `resttarterm` functions.\n\nNote that this issue can also be triggered by the ncurses's progs tools like `infocmp` and `tic`. However, they're not `setuid` binaries so they cannot be used for a privilege escalation.",

HSTS exists to remove the need for the common, insecure practice of redirecting users from `http://` to `https://` URLs.\n\n[Internationalized Domain Names](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215864977-Internationalized-domain-names-IDNs-) (IDNs) are domain names that contain characters other than unaccented Roman letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the hyphen. For instance, `日本語.idn.icann.org` contains Japanese characters.\n\n`curl` features an in-memory cache for `HSTS` hosts, so subsequent `HTTP-only` requests to a hostname present in the cache will get internally \"redirected\" to the `HTTPS` version.\n\nIt was discovered that the `HSTS` mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL first uses `IDN` characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the `IDN` conversion. Like using the UTF-8 character `U+3002` (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common `ASCII` full stop (U+002E) `.`. Then in a subsequent request, it does not detect the `HSTS` state and makes a clear text transfer. \n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable only when `curl` is executed with the non-default `--hsts` option.\n\nExample command-line usage that can trigger this issue -\n```\ncurl -v --hsts hsts.txt https://accounts.google.com。\ncurl -v --hsts hsts.txt http://accounts.google.com。\n```",

CVE-2023-38545 is “the worst security problem found in Curl in a long time”. For reference, the last vulnerability that was given a “High” severity by the Curl project is CVE-2021-22901 that was reported in May 2011.\n2. The vulnerability does not affect all users of Curl, the maintainers specifically mentioned “there is still going to be a large chunk of users who will not be affected by these problems” - probably due to attack preconditions of this vulnerability.\n3. The vulnerability is rated “High” although the Curl project does theoretically support designating vulnerabilities as “Critical” (this never happened so far).

HSTS exists to remove the need for the common, insecure practice of redirecting users from `http://` to `https://` URLs.\n\nCurl supports `HSTS` local cache which can be used through the command line using the following syntax: `curl --hsts hsts.txt https://hsts.example.com`.\nCurl also supports caching these `HSTS` headers in-memory instead of a file, by using the following syntax: `curl --hsts \"\" https://hsts.example.com`\n\nIt was discovered that when using the in-memory HSTS caching (`--hsts \"\"`) of curl, if more than one URL of the same domain is passed to the curl command line, and at least one of them (except the first one) starts with `http://` instead of `https://`, the request sent by curl will bypass the `HSTS` filter and use the insecure clear-text HTTP protocol.\nThis is despite the fact that the `--hsts` option should force the use of HTTPS.\n\nFor example, the following command line is insecure (take note of the use of in-memory HSTS caching and the same domain URLs): `curl --hsts \"\" https://hsts.example.com http://hsts.example.com`\n\nNote: only the curl command line using the `--hsts` option is vulnerable. `libcurl` is not affected by this vulnerability.",

This allows the server to act as a proxy for the client, using the client's credentials to access resources that the client may not have direct access to.\n\nTo delegate credentials, the client establishes a GSS-API security context with the server, and if the client supports delegation and has valid credentials, sends a \"forwardable\" ticket to the server. The server can then use this ticket to access resources on behalf of the client. \n\nlibcurl can reuse a previously created connection even when the delegation option had been changed which could have made the effective user no longer have access, thus leading to doing the second transfer with the wrong permissions.\n\nSpecifically, connecting to the same server while changing the following setting - `CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION` (or `--delegation` in curl command line) will erroneously re-use a previously cached connection (if the previous connection has been made from the same process), which is unexpected.\n\nGSS-API delegation can also be used with Kerberos. When using Kerberos with GSS-API delegation, the client obtains a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) during authentication, which can be used by the server to obtain a service ticket for accessing resources on behalf of the client. The server can then use the service ticket to access resources on the client's behalf without requiring the client to re-authenticate.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that a user would suddenly no longer have access because of a change in delegation in the second request.",

In this vulnerability, `curl` is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to improper parsing of HTTP headers. Headers that contain illegal non-printable characters, i.e. `0x01-0x08`, `0x0b-0x0c`, `0x0e-0x1f`,  `0x7f`,  should be normally disregarded, and not treated as valid cookies. For example:\n\n```\nCookie: name%01=content%08\n```\n\nMost web servers' implementation doesn't allow using these characters in requests and will respond with a `400 Bad Request` status code to any request that uses them. However, `curl` will process and save cookies containing these characters received for a web server.\n\nIf a web server would respond to `curl` with cookies that contain the above characters, `curl` would accept them. If `curl` is executed with `-c` option that stores the cookies and with `-b` option that sends the stored cookies in future requests, `curl` would send these cookies to the server, resulting in a denial of service on future requests to the server.\n\nA malicious actor wanting to exploit this vulnerability may need to be able to perform some sort of Man in the Middle attack, such as DNS spoofing/hijacking, in which invalid characters are injected in the server's response, causing `curl` to save cookies with these invalid characters.",

          "full_description": "The [debug/macho](https://pkg.go.dev/debug/macho) package in Go provides functionality to parse and analyze Mach-O (Mach Object) files, which are executable binary files used primarily in macOS and iOS operating systems.\nThe dynamic symbol table command within a `Mach-O` binary provides information about symbols that are dynamically linked during runtime. It includes details such as symbol names, addresses, and other relevant attributes for runtime symbol resolution.\n\nWhen opening a `Mach-O` binary with Go's `debug/macho` package, the `NewFile()` method lacks proper validation of symbol table indexes, particularly the `undefined symbol index`.\n\nThis vulnerability arises during parsing of the `dynamic symbol table` command and can result in processing symbols outside the binary's memory range. Additionally, the package does not verify if the number of undefined symbols exceeds the symbol table's length.\nThese issues can lead to an out-of-bounds read and may potentially result in a panic and a denial of service.\n\nThe `NewFile()` method can be also accessed through the publicly exposed functions `Open()` and `OpenFat()` in the `debug/macho` package. These functions are commonly utilized to open and parse Mach-O binary files.\n\nHere's an example of vulnerable code that demonstrates the issue when using `Open()` or `OpenFat()` on a Mach-O binary:\n```go\nfunc openMachOBinary() {\n\tfile, err := macho.Open(\"vulnerable_binary\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer file.Close()\n}\n```",

In case the user builds a Wasm module in Go - \n```\nGOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm  \n```\n\nAnd subsequently loads the Wasm module in the browser, **while passing arguments to it** -\n```js\n\u003cscript\u003e\n        const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)\n        const go = new Go();\n        WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(\"main.wasm\"), go.importObject).then((result) =\u003e {\n            go.argv = ['js', 'foo', params.get('external_argument')];\n            go.run(result.instance);\n        });\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\nIf an attacker can control one of the parameters passed to `go.argv` and subsequently cause the entire command line (`argv`) to exceed 4096 characters, then an attacker-controlled buffer overflow will occur. The attacker can use this buffer overflow to replace the entire contents if the compiled Wasm module and achieve arbitrary code execution in the browser's JavaScript (Wasm) sandbox.\n\nIn the example above, since `external_argument` comes from a query parameter, this would be achieved by surfing to a URL such as -\n`https://test.com/?external_argument=AAAAAA...{repeat 4096 times}...`\n\nCurrently, no public exploit or technical writeup were published for this issue.\n\nThe impact of exploiting the issue is not severe, since the attacker's code will run in the browser's JavaScript (Wasm) sandbox.

When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.",

Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.\n\nA fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is impractical, two short-term workarounds are available. Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`. Instead, consider cloning repositories without recursively cloning their submodules, and instead run `git submodule update` at each layer. Before doing so, inspect each new `.gitmodules` file to ensure that it does not contain suspicious module URLs.",

        "summary": "In Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, no localized messages are shipped with the installer. As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function's implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.\n\nThis vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`.",

However, when the patch file copies a symbolic link to another location, the type of the copied file is not checked before processing other lines in the patch file. This means that a copied symbolic link can be used to write/delete files outside the working directory, compromising the security of the system.\n\nExample of malicious patch file:\n```\ndiff --git a/symlink b/renamed-symlink\nsimilarity index 100%\nrename from symlink\nrename to renamed-symlink\n--\ndiff --git /dev/null b/renamed-symlink/../../../../tmp/malicious-file\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..039727e\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/renamed-symlink/create-me\n@@ -0,0 +1,1 @@\n+busted\n```\nGiving symlink is an existing Symbolic Link, the `git apply` command on this file writes the `/tmp/malicious-file` file outside the working directory.\n\nNote that the `git apply` can write a file only in the allowed path for this user, thus, executing this command as a low-privileged user limits the potential writing capability to only directories it can write into.",

In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

This function improperly uses an `int` to represent the number of entries in the arguments array, allowing an attacker to intentionally overflow the return value, leading to a heap overflow.\n\nThe size of `int` is 32-bit, which is around 2GB. An attacker needs to pass more than 2GB of data to cause the overflow, which is unlikely to be possible over SSH and also limited by the size of arguments the OS is willing to pass.\n\nEvery call to the `execve` functions family conforms to a Linux limit that limits the use of the stack. This limit affects the vulnerable buffer size in this vulnerability in practice. The maximum length of arguments for a new process may differ among Linux distributions.\n\nAlso, the input to `git-shell` resides 4 times in memory, so to overflow 2GB in memory - 8GB needs to be allocated. This increases the chance of crashing the process due to possible out-of-memory.\n\nThis issue is unlikely to be exploited because it requires `git shell` to be configured as a login shell, and interactive mode to be enabled by having the `$HOME/git-shell-commands` directory present, which is non-default.",

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a \"proper\" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future.

Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning\nwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files.

This functionality is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute. When processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable `git archive` in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive via `git daemon`, disable it by running `git config --global daemon.uploadArch false`.",

          "full_description": "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a popular distributed revision control system.\n\nFor displaying information about commits and other objects in the repository with more customization, Git introduced `pretty formats` through the `--pretty` option. For example, for displaying the log messages as follows`\u003ccommit-hash\u003e \u003ccommit-message\u003e \u003cauthor-name\u003e \u003cauthor-date\u003e`, the pretty option should be set as follow: `git log --pretty=format:\"%h %s %an %ad\"`.\n\nThe `format` mode also allows padding of the number of characters taken from the commit information with `padding`. This way, `git log --pretty=format:\"%h %B %20\u003c(20)%an %ad\"` would generate `\u003ccommit-hash\u003e \u003ccommit-message\u003e \u003cauthor-name-with-20-characters-width\u003e \u003cauthor-date\u003e`, thus padding the author-name to fit the number of character to 20. The width of the padding can be adjusted with the placeholders %\u003c(n) and %\u003e to specify left or right padding respectively.\n\nInteger overflows in the padding resolution logic lead to out-of-bounds write of the string defined by the format specifier, following the second padding specifier to a controlled offset. This can theoretically lead to code execution.\n\nThe exploitation of this issue depends on the attacker's ability to control the `--pretty` option in the `git log` that a user or an application would execute, which should be very rare.\n\nWhile attacking a Git client using this vulnerability would not be common because of the above prerequisite, the threat to Git server is more severe. The `pretty format` is also used in [git archive](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive) operations via the [export-subst](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#_export_subst) attribute. In order to exploit the vulnerability on the server side, an attacker should create a new repository on the targeted Git server, add a file with the `$Format:%\u003e(2147483645)\u003cPAYLOAD\u003e$` (for example, example.txt) and add the file in the `.gitattributes` file with the `export-subst` attribute as follow: `example.txt export-subst`. Executing `git archive` with the `--remote` flag will trigger the vulnerability directly on the server side. It will not crash the Git server as a thread is created when executing the `git archive` command (so the thread would only crash). However, as any hexadecimal can be written, exploiting it for code execution seems possible. \n\nNote that some Git hosting services like GitHub block the `git archive` command.\n\nIf `git archive` is exposed via `git daemon`, it can be disabled by running `git config --global daemon.uploadArch false`.",

          "full_description": "[MIT Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a network authentication protocol that uses secret key cryptography to secure communications over a computer network. \n\n[Privilege Attribute Certificate](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Kerberos_PAC) (PAC) is a data structure that is used in the Kerberos network authentication protocol to store authorization data for a user. It is used to determine what resources a user is allowed to access and what actions they are allowed to perform. \n\nA PAC is typically embedded in a ticket that is issued by the Kerberos authentication server and passed to the client system when the user logs in. The client system uses the PAC to determine the user's permissions when the user attempts to access a resource.\n\nThe client system will send the ticket and the PAC to the resource server, which will use the information contained in the PAC to determine whether the user is allowed to access the resource. If the user is authorized, the resource server will grant access to the resource. If the user is not authorized, the resource server will deny access to the resource.\n\nThe Kerberos' PAC parser lacks a size check that prevents an integer overflow. A crafted PAC can either: \n- Cause a smaller-than-needed buffer allocation that will contain the PAC parsed data and can subsequently lead to a heap-buffer overflow which might lead to remote code execution (on 32-bit systems only),\n- Cause a bigger-than-needed buffer allocation which will lead to a read out-of-bounds and possible DoS.\n\nSince the PAC is parsed only after extraction from a decrypted ticket, the attacker needs to produce a ticket that the victim can decrypt. For that reason, among the services using Kerberos protocol, the Key Distribution Center (KDC) is an easy target as any authenticated attacker can print a ticket encrypted with their own long-term key and get the KDC to parse the PAC contained within. \n\n[A patch](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/ea92d2f0fcceb54a70910fa32e9a0d7a5afc3583#diff-3d55ac988ef62053c69e7250eee0396116679f0d1327cc441c8d8f20501700b4) was released for the MIT Kerberos. \nSamba implements their own version of Kerberos library and released a [patch](https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/patches/security/samba-4.17.3-security-2022-11-15.patch).\nHeimdal also released a [patch](https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/commit/d16a9db259c9d488fe8ab8622079c4ba6f9b760b).\n\nThis issue also impacts [Microsoft's Kerberos in Active Directory](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2022-42898.html).",

The library contains the tools, APIs, and utilities necessary for applications and systems to integrate Kerberos for authentication and secure communication.\n\n`GSS tokens` are part of the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API) used to provide secure communication between applications. A `GSS wrap token` is essentially a chunk of data that encapsulates encrypted data required for authentication, integrity, and confidentiality during Kerberos communication.\n\nIn MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5), attackers can craft the plaintext `Extra Count` field of a confidential GSS krb5 wrap token, causing the unwrapped token to appear truncated to the application.\nIn a truncation attack, the attacker somehow craft the message to indicate the message has finished in a way that will prevent the recipient picking up the rest of the message. This kind of attacks may lead to authentication bypass but rely heavily on the attacker ability to MiTM.\n\nThe general structure of a wrap token contains a header which includes the `Extra Count` field and an encrypted part which includes the message.\nA wrap token with a different value of `Extra Count` field between the plaintext and encrypted copies will be erroneously accepted, which allows a message truncation attack.\n\nThe wrap token header structure is similar to:\n```\nTOK_ID      : 2 byte\nFlags       : 1 byte\nFiller      : 1 byte\nExtra Count : 2 byte\nRRC         : 2 byte\n// Data (Encrypted)\n```\n\nTo successfully exploit this vulnerability the attacker will have to override the RRC field and the encrypted data in a way which will cause the receiving application think it got all of the message. This may lead to several issues, from authentication bypass to DoS.",

        "summary": "Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. All versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically, the said component extracts a user-controlled tar.gz file without validating the size of its inner files. As a result, a malicious, low-privileged user can send a malicious tar.gz file that exploits this vulnerability to the repo-server, thereby harming the system's functionality and availability. Additionally, the repo-server is susceptible to another vulnerability due to the fact that it does not check the extracted file permissions before attempting to delete them. Consequently, an attacker can craft a malicious tar.gz archive in a way that prevents the deletion of its inner files when the manifest generation process is completed. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.15, 2.7.14, and 2.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade. The only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade, however users unable to upgrade should configure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and provide access for configuring applications only to a limited number of administrators. These administrators should utilize trusted and verified Helm charts.",

Due to the improper URL protocols filtering of links specified in the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations in the application summary component, an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with elevated permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim's permissions (up to and including admin). This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes resources. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8, and v2.8.12. There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative, if upgrading is not possible, would be to create a Kubernetes admission controller to reject any resources with an annotation starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the value use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be applied in all clusters managed by ArgoCD.",

An improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is not enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source. The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added. The bug has been patched in Argo CD versions 2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12. Users are advised to upgrade.

This loophole in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account. This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827 intended to protect against brute-force attacks. The application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users, thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for that account. This is a severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force attacks at an accelerated rate, especially targeting the default admin account.

The Argo CD API prior to versions 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15 are vulnerable to a cross-server request forgery (CSRF) attack when the attacker has the ability to write HTML to a page on the same parent domain as Argo CD. A CSRF attack works by tricking an authenticated Argo CD user into loading a web page which contains code to call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim’s behalf. For example, an attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a page which looks harmless but in the background calls an Argo CD API endpoint to create an application running malicious code. Argo CD uses the “Lax” SameSite cookie policy to prevent CSRF attacks where the attacker controls an external domain. The malicious external website can attempt to call the Argo CD API, but the web browser will refuse to send the Argo CD auth token with the request. Many companies host Argo CD on an internal subdomain. If an attacker can place malicious code on, for example, https://test.internal.example.com/, they can still perform a CSRF attack. In this case, the “Lax” SameSite cookie does not prevent the browser from sending the auth cookie, because the destination is a parent domain of the Argo CD API. Browsers generally block such attacks by applying CORS policies to sensitive requests with sensitive content types. Specifically, browsers will send a “preflight request” for POSTs with content type “application/json” asking the destination API “are you allowed to accept requests from my domain?” If the destination API does not answer “yes,” the browser will block the request. Before the patched versions, Argo CD did not validate that requests contained the correct content type header. So an attacker could bypass the browser’s CORS check by setting the content type to something which is considered “not sensitive” such as “text/plain.” The browser wouldn’t send the preflight request, and Argo CD would happily accept the contents (which are actually still JSON) and...",

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -\u003e ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.",

        "summary": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

          "full_description": "SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that provides a secure way to access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network. [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) refers to an open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, offering encrypted communication for secure access to remote systems over networks.\n\n[AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures secure and efficient encryption and decryption of data.\n\nThe Terrapin attack is a novel cryptographic attack in the SSH protocol itself, causing the compromised client to erroneously perceive that the server lacks support for recent signature algorithms used in user authentication, through a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. It affects a wide range of implementations, including but not limited to OpenSSH, Paramiko, and others. \n\nThere are two vulnerable SSH configurations:\n1. `ChaCha20-Poly1305`\n2. Any `aes(128|192|256)-cbc` ciphers using the default MACs (or any MAC that uses Encrypt-then-MAC, EtM, for example - `hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`).\n\nThe default OpenSSH client and server are vulnerable to this attack, as they are configured to allow the vulnerable `ChaCha20-Poly1305` cipher. \n\nNote that updating either the server or client is not enough! Both must be patched. A vulnerable client connecting to a fixed server will still result in a vulnerable connection.\n\nIn OpenSSH 9.5, a new feature involving [keystroke timing obfuscation](https://lwn.net/Articles/298833/) was introduced. This attack enables a MitM attacker to disable this feature, and consequently to perform a keystroke timing attack against OpenSSH.\n\nThe researchers describe the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher integration as easier to exploit than the aes-cbc EtM. \n\nIn this scenario, a prefix truncation attack is employed, wherein the attacker manipulates sequence numbers to selectively delete chosen packets from the start of a communication channel, compromising channel integrity without detection. Specifically, the attacker can omit the `EXT_INFO` message, crucial for negotiating various protocol extensions (specific signature algorithms) without detection by the client or server. To evade detection, the attacker introduces an ignored packet during the handshake, ensuring the sequence numbers remain aligned.",

This function is commonly used in SSH-related applications to ensure the integrity and authenticity of received data. It returns `SSH_OK` when the signature is valid, or `SSH_ERROR` otherwise.\nThis function performs a chain of verification. After the first check, the return code is set to `SSH_OK` but then any memory error makes the function enters a block of code simply going out of the function with the current return code, which in this precise case, at the right moment, can be set to `SSH_OK`. \n\nThe exposed vulnerable function is the `ssh_handle_key_exchange()` function, handling the key exchange.\n\nNote that while CVE-2023-2283 in LibSSH poses a severe threat and potentially leads to an authentication bypass, the exploitability is limited to very-specific low-memory setups like memory-constrained containers, narrowing its impact. Effectively triggering the flaw demands substantial effort like timing a precise application bombing. Specifically, If libssh is running on a 64-bit server with plenty of RAM then it is very unlikely that an attacker will be able to generate enough memory pressure to cause an out-of-memory error and trigger the vulnerability.\n\nVulnerable example from [ssh_server_fork](https://github.com/xbmc/libssh/blob/master/examples/ssh_server_fork.c) -\n```\n    if (ssh_handle_key_exchange(session) != SSH_OK) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"%s\\n\", ssh_get_error(session));\n        return;\n    }\n```\n\nA public exploit exists for this issue which triggers the authentication bypass, which makes exploitation much more likely.",

          "full_description": "The `pam_namespace` module is part of the Linux PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) system. Its goal is to enhance user isolation by creating private mount namespaces for each user session. Within these namespaces, it can polyinstantiate certain directories (like `/tmp` or `$HOME`), giving each user or session a private version that’s hidden from others. This helps prevent information leaks, symlink attacks, and other types of local privilege escalation in multi-user environments.\n\n`pam_namespace` is designed to isolate user directories using mount namespaces. However, due to incomplete protection against symlink/race condition attacks, an unprivileged user can potentially gain root access.\nThe attacker must be able to launch a controlled process outside of their PAM session, by doing so they will be able to alter the paths on which `pam_namespace` is operating as root.\n\nThis can allow attackers to -\n1. Launch symlink attacks on a path used by `pam_namespace` during polyinstantiation setup\n2. Launch race condition attacks on the security checks in `pam_namespace`\nEither of these can allow the local attacker to escalate privileges to root\n\nThis is more feasible if:\n1. The system has multiple users colluding with each other or-\n2. PAM services are misconfigured and do not call `pam_namespace`\n\n\nExamples:\n\n1. If two users on the same system are either colluding or both compromised, one of them can tamper with the paths used to polyinstantiate directories for the other. This is possible because each user operates within their own PAM session, which places them in a separate mount namespace. As a result, the restrictions enforced by `pam_namespace` do not apply across these namespaces, allowing one user to interfere with the other's environment.\n\n2. If a PAM service is misconfigured and fails to invoke `pam_namespace` during the creation of a new PAM session, it opens up a potential security gap. This kind of misconfiguration is not uncommon, as some packages provide PAM service files that omit the standard, distribution-provided configuration files (like `common-session` or `system-auth`).",

The internal function `s_find_uninit_var()` checks for uninitialized variables. In case both the array/hash and the index are undefined, the warning mechanism tries to get the value of the index and then enters an infinite loop which causes stack exhaustion and eventually leads to Denial of Service.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n```perl\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse warnings;\n$x{$y}  # or $x[$y] where both x and y are undefined.\n```",

          "full_description": "[CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/) (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) is a repository of over 200,000 modules for the Perl programming language. \n\nTo install Perl modules from CPAN, users can use either the `cpan` client provided by [CPAN.pm](https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN) (included in the Perl core) or the `cpanm` client provided by [cpanminus](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus).\n\nWhen downloading a module, the cpan client retrieves a tarball with an encrypted `CHECKSUMS` file. The client generates its own local `CHECKSUMS` file for the downloaded file and compares it to the downloaded CHECKSUMS file. **By default**, the client only compares the `CHECKSUMS` files content but **does not validate the authenticity of the downloaded `CHECKSUMS` file**. To enable this option in cpan, the user can run the following command: `o conf check_sigs 1` and to make the changes persistent, run `o conf commit` after the first command.\n\nHowever, even when signature checking is enabled, there is a flaw in the `CHECKSUMS` file validation logic. An attacker can add a prepended checksum for a modified package to the beginning of the `CHECKSUMS` file, which will cause the `Module::Signature::_verify()` function to pass and trigger the installation even though the return code is `CANNOT_VERIFY`, which will be considered as `SIGNATURE_OK`.\n\nThis issue can be used to carry out supply chain attacks, as demonstrated in the [PoC](https://blog.hackeriet.no/cpan-signature-verification-vulnerabilities/). The attacker must create their own CPAN mirror, change the targeted module to add its malicious behaviors, calculate the new checksums from its files and add the calculated checksum to the beginning of the associated `CHECKSUMS` file.",

This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.",

          "full_description": "[zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib) is a popular general purpose data compression library.\n\nzlib supports processing gzip archives. As such, it provides the `inflateGetHeader()` method used to get the header information of a gzip archive. The header is always checked for validity, including the header CRC if present. \nWhen the `inflateGetHeader()` is called, it will make the `inflate()` method read and copy the header of a gzip in a structure passed as a parameter to the `inflateGetHeader()` method, otherwise it will discard the header. If the extra header field is big enough, it will cause the `inflate()` method to be called multiple times to get the full content of this extra field. As there is an improper extra field size check, it can cause a heap buffer overflow.\nThe vulnerability can be exploited if and only if the target program calls `inflateGetHeader()`.\nThe attacker should find a remote input that propagates to the `inflate()` method with the `inflateGetHeader()` method being called.\n\nExample:\n```\nz_stream strm;\ngz_header head;\n\nif ((r = inflateInit2(\u0026strm, stream_size)) != Z_OK)\n\tgoto fail;\nif ((r = inflateGetHeader(\u0026strm, \u0026head)) != Z_OK) {\n\tinflateEnd(\u0026strm);\n\tgoto fail;\n}\nr = inflate(\u0026strm, Z_NO_FLUSH);\n```\nThe above code is vulnerable as it is calling the `inflateGetHeader()` method and the `inflate()` method for crafter gzip header.",

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.",

It enables developers to work with pixmap images, offering support for creating, manipulating, and displaying these images in X Window System applications.\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered due to a missing check inside both libXpm and libX11, which may lead to remote code execution.\nThe 'XCreateImage()' function in libX11 did not check properly for the image dimensions when creating a new image, which leads to an integer overflow.\nAs part of the bug report, a proof-of-concept demonstrating remote code execution was included.\n\nThe PoC leveraged the bug in libXpm code during the parsing of Pixmap images to trigger the vulnerability in libX11.\nThis vulnerability can be exploited through various means, including the 'sxpm' command-line tool provided by libXpm for displaying Pixmap images on the screen, as well as any application that utilizes the vulnerable functions (for example, `XpmReadFileToPixmap`) within libXpm to parse Pixmap images.\n\nAn example for a vulnerable Xpm code snippet:\n```\n#include \u003cstdio.h\u003e\n#include \u003cX11/Xlib.h\u003e\n#include \u003cX11/Xutil.h\u003e\n\nmain()\n{\n\tDisplay *display;\n\tPixmap *pixmap, *shape;\n\tWindow window, rootwindow;\n\tint width, height, screen;\n\tchar* xpmfile = \"file.xpm\";\n\n\tdisplay = XOpenDisplay (NULL);\n\tscreen = DefaultScreen (display);\n\twidth = DisplayWidth (display, screen);\n\theight = DisplayHeight (display, screen);\n\trootwindow = RootWindow (display, screen);\n\n\twindow = XCreateSimpleWindow (display, rootwindow, 0, 0, width, height, 0, 0, 0);\n\tXpmReadFileToPixmap (display, window, xpmfile, \u0026pixmap, \u0026shape, NULL);\n}\n```",

In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.",

          "full_description": "[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) is a popular open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, providing encrypted communication over a network.\n`VerifyHostKeyDNS` feature in OpenSSH enables the SSH client to authenticate a server's host key by querying DNS for its SSHFP (SSH Fingerprint) record. When active, this feature checks the server's fingerprint in DNS to confirm its legitimacy before making a connection.\nCVE-2025-26465 relies on the `VerifyHostKeyDNS` feature, which is not enabled by default (in FreeBSD the feature was enabled by default from 2013 to 2023).\n\nExploiting CVE-2025-26465 in a MiTM attack could potentially cause the SSH client to accept an attacker’s key instead of the legitimate server's, compromising the connection’s integrity. This would allow attackers to intercept or manipulate the session, potentially stealing credentials or accessing sensitive information. This attack will require the `VerifyHostKeyDNS` to be set in the client.\n\nCurrently successful exploitation of this CVE requires another vulnerability (such as CVE-2025-26466) in order to cause an out-of-memory error in the client. This will enable the attacker to later on use CVE-2025-26465 to bypass authentication.",

          "full_description": "[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) is a popular open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, providing encrypted communication over a network.\nOpenSSH configuration is a text file that allows users to customize the behavior of the OpenSSH client and server. The configuration file is usually located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for the server and `~/.ssh/config` for the client.\n\nIts goal is to specify various settings, such as host-specific options, preferred algorithms, and authentication methods. When a `Host` is defined, the configuration allows users to set parameters specifically for connections to that host. The non-default `ProxyCommand` directive, when used, specifies the command to use for connecting to the server via a proxy, enabling users to traverse intermediate hosts or jump hosts to reach their destination.\n\nExample of configuration using ProxyCommand:\n```\nHost *.example.com\n ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p \n```\nIn this example, at each SSH connection to `example.com`, the `ProxyCommand` command will be executed and the tokens will be expanded accordingly. Especially, `%h` and `%r` are tokens for the hostname and the remote username.\nBoth tokens are expanded and the value is directly copied instead of being checked before. Thus, if the attackers control the hostname/remote username, they can theoretically inject commands in the ProxyCommand command. \nThus, this example of configuration is vulnerable as it uses `ProxyCommand` with the `%h` token.\n\nTo exploit this issue, the attacker has to control the OpenSSH configuration (which is very unlikely to be controlled by users) or to be able to exploit a non-default existing `ProxyCommand` configuration and cause the client to perform requests to a malicious hostname in the domain range of the pre-configured `Host` directive (like *.example.com as demonstrated above)\n\n[An interesting PoC that was published](https://github.com/vin01/poc-proxycommand-vulnerable) for this CVE demonstrates how a pre-configured `ProxyCommand` can be exploited. The public PoC triggers the issue through a remote Git submodule. The attacker hides the malicious shell command in a .gitmodules file and when the victim recursively clones the malicious repository, git uses SSH to clone the malicious submodule. Since git uses SSH with the configuration's Host, OpenSSH will replace %h with the attacker-controlled hostname containing the malicious cmd and execute the `ProxyCommand`. The use of shell metacharacters allows the attacker to use command substitution (`) and run arbitrary code.\n\nThe exploitation requirement of a non-default OpenSSH config minimizes the number of vulnerable machines and limits the issue for specific scenarios like cloning a malicious Git repo. It is still possible other attack scenarios are exploitable, so this issue is worth mitigating.",

This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nAn iptables rule designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that c...",

A firewalld vulnerability affects Moby releases before 28.0.0. When firewalld reloads, Docker fails to re-create iptables rules that isolate bridge networks, allowing any container to access all ports on any other container across different bridge networks on the same host. This breaks network segmentation between containers that should be isolated, creating significant risk in multi-tenant environments. Only containers in --internal networks remain protected.\nWorkarounds include reloading firewalld and either restarting the docker daemon, re-creating bridge networks, or using rootless mode. Maintainers anticipate a fix for this issue in version 25.0.13.",

Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will ...",

When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme.

An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default. Patches are included in 24.0.9 and 25.0.2 releases.",

          "full_description": "[Moby](https://mobyproject.org/) is an open-source framework provided by Docker for building customized, specialized containers and is widely used by developers working with docker containers.\n\nUsually, when using Moby to build docker images, the first line will be `FROM \u003cimage\u003e`, where `image` will serve as the [base image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) for the new docker build. However, there is another option - `FROM scratch`. When using this option, there is no base image at all - which can be helpful for creating minimal images. \n\nWhen building a docker image, to make the build process more efficient, docker [locally caches](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/) the already used layers in a directory on the host where the docker daemon is running. This way, the next time the build is requested, layers that weren't changed are loaded from the cache instead of built again.\n\nHowever, when utilizing the caching system on builds that use `FROM scratch`, insufficient validation of the cached layers could let an attacker create an image that passes the checks for a cache candidate - injecting a potentially malicious image into the build process. Such an attacker would need prior knowledge of the Dockerfile used and be able to insert malicious images into the cache saved on the host.\n\nNote that users with version 23.0 and above would need to manually opt out of using the default Buildkit image builder or use the /build API endpoint to be vulnerable.",

With libcap, you can assign specific capabilities to a process or binary, allowing it to perform privileged operations without requiring full root access.\n\nThe library implementation has a bug in the ` _libcap_strdup()` function. The code that checks for integer overflow assumes that the computed value of `len` will always be less than the max value of a 32-bit unsigned int. This bad logic assumption leads to integer overflow and heap overwrite when supplying large input (close to 4 GB).\n\nAn attacker must be able to find an input that propagates into the vulnerable function in order to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, this vulnerability is only applicable on a 64-bit kernel in 32-bit compatibility mode (a feature that allows 32-bit applications to run on a 64-bit Linux system). \n\nThe official fix solves this issue by checking for integer overflow earlier and comparing max int against the old value of `len` (`old`) and only after that computing its new value. In this way, the integer overflow check is effective in preventing integer overflow attacks.",

PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth.

A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is actually used to authenticate.\n\nHowever, it has been discovered that some applications might misuse this API and assume that the last key passed to this function is actually the key used in the authentication process. This assumption may be wrong, due to the caching behavior of the package. Vulnerable applications might later rely on this wrong assumption and make authorization decisions based on this key. An attacker may utilize this for user confusion, essentially bypassing authorization.\n\nApplications are only vulnerable if they rely on the last key passed to `PublicKeyCallback` and make authentication decisions based on it. For example:\n```\nfunc runServer(conn net.Conn) error {\n\tvar pubkey string\n\n\tconfig := ssh.ServerConfig{\n\t\tPublicKeyCallback: func(conn ssh.ConnMetadata, key ssh.PublicKey) (*ssh.Permissions, error) {\n\t\t\tpubkey = ssh.FingerprintSHA256(key)\n\t\t\treturn \u0026ssh.Permissions{}, nil\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\n\tserverConn, chans, reqs, err := ssh.NewServerConn(conn, config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\t// now make decisions based on pubkey\n}\n```\n\nThe patch provided for this issue made it so the assumed property of `PublicKeyCallback` actually holds, and the last key passed to it is the key used to authenticate.

        "summary": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

          "full_description": "SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that provides a secure way to access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network. [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) refers to an open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, offering encrypted communication for secure access to remote systems over networks.\n\n[AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures secure and efficient encryption and decryption of data.\n\nThe Terrapin attack is a novel cryptographic attack in the SSH protocol itself, causing the compromised client to erroneously perceive that the server lacks support for recent signature algorithms used in user authentication, through a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. It affects a wide range of implementations, including but not limited to OpenSSH, Paramiko, and others. \n\nThere are two vulnerable SSH configurations:\n1. `ChaCha20-Poly1305`\n2. Any `aes(128|192|256)-cbc` ciphers using the default MACs (or any MAC that uses Encrypt-then-MAC, EtM, for example - `hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`).\n\nThe default OpenSSH client and server are vulnerable to this attack, as they are configured to allow the vulnerable `ChaCha20-Poly1305` cipher. \n\nNote that updating either the server or client is not enough! Both must be patched. A vulnerable client connecting to a fixed server will still result in a vulnerable connection.\n\nIn OpenSSH 9.5, a new feature involving [keystroke timing obfuscation](https://lwn.net/Articles/298833/) was introduced. This attack enables a MitM attacker to disable this feature, and consequently to perform a keystroke timing attack against OpenSSH.\n\nThe researchers describe the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher integration as easier to exploit than the aes-cbc EtM. \n\nIn this scenario, a prefix truncation attack is employed, wherein the attacker manipulates sequence numbers to selectively delete chosen packets from the start of a communication channel, compromising channel integrity without detection. Specifically, the attacker can omit the `EXT_INFO` message, crucial for negotiating various protocol extensions (specific signature algorithms) without detection by the client or server. To evade detection, the attacker introduces an ignored packet during the handshake, ensuring the sequence numbers remain aligned.",

It provides a simple C language application programming interface (API) to access the secure communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12, and other required structures.\n\nIn GnuTLS, establishing a TLS connection involves exchanging keys beforehand. It was discovered that the response time to this key exchange depends on the size of encrypted data when processing PKCS#1 v1.5 encrypted data. An attacker might be able to perform a timing side-channel attack to extract information about the RSA key by observing the time it takes to perform this operation.\n\nThe specific possible side-channel attack due to this issue is called [Bleichenbacher's Attack](https://medium.com/@c0D3M/bleichenbacher-attack-explained-bc630f88ff25) and requires timing the server responses by sending a large amount of different malformed RSA ciphertext messages.\n\nTo perform this attack, an attacker would need to be on the same machine or subnet where the decryption takes place and to be able to trigger many decryption operations (oracle attack).\n\nA successful attack would compromise the server's private RSA key, allowing the attacker to decrypt any sniffed TLS traffic sent to or from the server from any host.",

Since `zstd` is a standalone (forked) tool - the crash has a minimal security impact.\n\nSpecifically, passing the `--output-dir-flat` or `--output-dir-mirror` arguments with an empty string, leads to an OOB read.\n\nIt should be noted that the OOB read is of 1 byte only, which on modern systems does not even lead to a crash (in most cases of production-built software)",
