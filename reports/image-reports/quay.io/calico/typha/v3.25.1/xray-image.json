          "full_description": "[The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) is a fundamental protocol of the World Wide Web, enabling the exchange of data between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. It defines the rules for requesting and transmitting web pages and other resources over the internet. Request and response messages are exchanged as a stream of ASCII characters, sent over a reliable transport layer like TCP.\n\n[HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) is a modern network protocol designed to improve the performance and efficiency of web communication. It replaces the older HTTP/1.1 protocol and introduces features like header compression and enhanced request cancellation mechanisms, which collectively enhance the speed and responsiveness of websites.\n\nThis request cancellation mechanism allows clients to terminate unnecessary or redundant requests without waiting for a server's response, reducing network congestion and further improving the overall responsiveness of web applications.\n\nHTTP/2 resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload. The stream ID is essential in clearly associating specific bytes on the network with their corresponding messages, facilitating secure multiplexing and concurrent processing. These streams are bidirectional, enabling clients to transmit frames, and servers to respond with frames using the same ID.\n\nAs detailed in [this technical analysis](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/), there's a vulnerability in the way request cancellation is implemented. The flaw lies in the process of sending an excessive number of requests (specifically, `HEADERS` frames), each immediately followed by a request cancellation frame utilizing the `RST_STREAM` frame. This sequence rapidly leads to a substantial consumption of server-side resources. Consequently, this vulnerability amplifies the risk of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, making it easier to overwhelm and exhaust the server's available resources.\n\nA lot of server applications are vulnerable to the Http/2 Rapid Reset attack.\nHowever, note that HTTP/2 must be enabled, which is not the default configuration on most applications (excluding nghttp2 for example).\nA non-exhaustive list of these vulnerable web applications:\n```\n- Tomcat\n- Jetty\n- NGINX on certain conditions\n- nghttp2\n- Netty\n```",

          "remediation": "##### Deployment mitigations\n\nA possible mitigation is to limit the maximum number of requests that can be made over a single keep-alive connection.\n\n##### Deployment mitigations\n\nFor NGINX:\n\nDisabling HTTP/2 in NGINX is not necessary. Simply ensure you have configured:\n\n- `keepalive_requests` should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests\n- `http2_max_concurrent_streams` should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams\n- `limit_conn` and `limit_req` should be set \"with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security\"\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Nghttp2:\nImplement `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback` callback function, and check and count `RST_STREAM` frames. If an excessive number of `RST_STREAM` frames are received, then take action, such as dropping the connection silently, or calling `nghttp2_submit_goaway` and gracefully terminate the connection.\n```c\n#include \u003cnghttp2/nghttp2.h\u003e\n\n// Callback function for handling frame reception\nint on_frame_recv_callback(nghttp2_session* session,\n                           const nghttp2_frame* frame, void* user_data) {\n    // Check if the received frame is an RST_STREAM frame\n    if (frame-\u003ehd.type == NGHTTP2_RST_STREAM) {\n        // Increment a counter for RST_STREAM frames\n        int* rst_stream_counter = (int*)user_data;\n        (*rst_stream_counter)++;\n        \n        // Define a threshold for excessive RST_STREAM frames\n        int rst_stream_threshold = 10;  // Adjust this value as needed\n        \n        // If the threshold is exceeded, take action (e.g., close the connection)\n        if (*rst_stream_counter \u003e rst_stream_threshold) {\n            // Here, you can choose to close the connection gracefully or drop it\n            // For demonstration purposes, we'll just print a message\n            printf(\"Excessive RST_STREAM frames received.

This value may be adjusted in the `golang.org/x/net/http2` package using the `Server.MaxConcurrentStreams` setting and the `ConfigureServer` function which are available in `golang.org/x/net/http2`.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/net/http2\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Create an HTTP/2 server instance\n\thttp2Server := \u0026http2.Server{}\n\n\t// Set the desired stream concurrency limit\n\tmaxConcurrentStreams := 500 // Change this to your desired limit\n\thttp2Server.MaxConcurrentStreams = uint32(maxConcurrentStreams)\n\n\t// Configure an HTTP server to use HTTP/2 with the adjusted settings\n\tserver := \u0026http.Server{\n\t\tAddr:    \":8080\",\n\t\tHandler: http.HandlerFunc(handleRequest),\n\t}\n\thttp2.ConfigureServer(server, http2Server)\n\n\t// Start the HTTP server\n\terr := server.ListenAndServeTLS(\"cert.pem\", \"key.pem\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor netty:\n```java\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameListener;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameStream;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2ResetFrame;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2HeadersFrame;\n\npublic class CustomHttp2FrameListener implements Http2FrameListener {\n    private int rstFrameCount = 0;\n    private int maxRstFrameCount = 10; // Adjust this to your desired limit\n    private long resetTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    private long resetTimeIntervalMillis = 60000; // 60 seconds\n\n    @Override\n    public int onDataRead(Http2FrameStream stream, byte[] data, int padding, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle data frames if needed\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onRstStreamRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2ResetFrame resetFrame) {\n        long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n        \n        // Check if the reset time interval has passed, and reset the count if needed\n        if (currentTimeMillis - resetTimeMillis \u003e= resetTimeIntervalMillis) {\n            rstFrameCount = 0;\n            resetTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis;\n        }\n        \n        rstFrameCount++;\n        \n        // Check if the count exceeds the limit\n        if (rstFrameCount \u003e maxRstFrameCount) {\n            // Take action, e.g., close the connection, log, or drop frames\n            // You can use stream or resetFrame to get more context if needed.\n            // To close the connection, you can use stream.connection().close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"

This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.

These frames include frame type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload.\n\nThe `HEADERS` frame type allows sending HTTP headers of, both, request and response. The `HEADERS` frame contains many flags.\nThe `CONTINUATION` frame type is similar to the `HEADER` frame, but it has just one flag: `END_HEADERS`. When it is not set, the peer knows that more headers are coming in the following `CONTINUATION` frames.\n\nThis mechanism allows an attacker to send an `HTTP/2` stream with `CONTINUATION` frames, without setting the `END_HEADERS` flag in any of the frames. This can cause denial-of-service when sending an excessive number of these crafted frames due to caching all frames in memory.\n\nThough the `net/http` package uses HTTP/2 by default, a Golang web server must have HTTPS configured to be vulnerable to exploitation.\nThe `x/net/http2` package is vulnerable by default.",

        "summary": "A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth.

A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is actually used to authenticate.\n\nHowever, it has been discovered that some applications might misuse this API and assume that the last key passed to this function is actually the key used in the authentication process. This assumption may be wrong, due to the caching behavior of the package. Vulnerable applications might later rely on this wrong assumption and make authorization decisions based on this key. An attacker may utilize this for user confusion, essentially bypassing authorization.\n\nApplications are only vulnerable if they rely on the last key passed to `PublicKeyCallback` and make authentication decisions based on it. For example:\n```\nfunc runServer(conn net.Conn) error {\n\tvar pubkey string\n\n\tconfig := ssh.ServerConfig{\n\t\tPublicKeyCallback: func(conn ssh.ConnMetadata, key ssh.PublicKey) (*ssh.Permissions, error) {\n\t\t\tpubkey = ssh.FingerprintSHA256(key)\n\t\t\treturn \u0026ssh.Permissions{}, nil\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\n\tserverConn, chans, reqs, err := ssh.NewServerConn(conn, config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\t// now make decisions based on pubkey\n}\n```\n\nThe patch provided for this issue made it so the assumed property of `PublicKeyCallback` actually holds, and the last key passed to it is the key used to authenticate.

          "full_description": "SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that provides a secure way to access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network. [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) refers to an open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, offering encrypted communication for secure access to remote systems over networks.\n\n[AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures secure and efficient encryption and decryption of data.\n\nThe Terrapin attack is a novel cryptographic attack in the SSH protocol itself, causing the compromised client to erroneously perceive that the server lacks support for recent signature algorithms used in user authentication, through a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. It affects a wide range of implementations, including but not limited to OpenSSH, Paramiko, and others. \n\nThere are two vulnerable SSH configurations:\n1. `ChaCha20-Poly1305`\n2. Any `aes(128|192|256)-cbc` ciphers using the default MACs (or any MAC that uses Encrypt-then-MAC, EtM, for example - `hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`).\n\nThe default OpenSSH client and server are vulnerable to this attack, as they are configured to allow the vulnerable `ChaCha20-Poly1305` cipher. \n\nNote that updating either the server or client is not enough! Both must be patched. A vulnerable client connecting to a fixed server will still result in a vulnerable connection.\n\nIn OpenSSH 9.5, a new feature involving [keystroke timing obfuscation](https://lwn.net/Articles/298833/) was introduced. This attack enables a MitM attacker to disable this feature, and consequently to perform a keystroke timing attack against OpenSSH.\n\nThe researchers describe the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher integration as easier to exploit than the aes-cbc EtM. \n\nIn this scenario, a prefix truncation attack is employed, wherein the attacker manipulates sequence numbers to selectively delete chosen packets from the start of a communication channel, compromising channel integrity without detection. Specifically, the attacker can omit the `EXT_INFO` message, crucial for negotiating various protocol extensions (specific signature algorithms) without detection by the client or server. To evade detection, the attacker introduces an ignored packet during the handshake, ensuring the sequence numbers remain aligned.",

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.",

The issue arises from an incorrect SUID (Set User ID) bit configuration in the binary, combined with the ability to control the input binary, allowing an attacker to execute an arbitrary binary with elevated privileges.",
