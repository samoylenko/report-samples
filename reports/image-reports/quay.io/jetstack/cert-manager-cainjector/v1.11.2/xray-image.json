This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.

These frames include frame type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload.\n\nThe `HEADERS` frame type allows sending HTTP headers of, both, request and response. The `HEADERS` frame contains many flags.\nThe `CONTINUATION` frame type is similar to the `HEADER` frame, but it has just one flag: `END_HEADERS`. When it is not set, the peer knows that more headers are coming in the following `CONTINUATION` frames.\n\nThis mechanism allows an attacker to send an `HTTP/2` stream with `CONTINUATION` frames, without setting the `END_HEADERS` flag in any of the frames. This can cause denial-of-service when sending an excessive number of these crafted frames due to caching all frames in memory.\n\nThough the `net/http` package uses HTTP/2 by default, a Golang web server must have HTTPS configured to be vulnerable to exploitation.\nThe `x/net/http2` package is vulnerable by default.",

          "full_description": "[The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) is a fundamental protocol of the World Wide Web, enabling the exchange of data between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. It defines the rules for requesting and transmitting web pages and other resources over the internet. Request and response messages are exchanged as a stream of ASCII characters, sent over a reliable transport layer like TCP.\n\n[HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) is a modern network protocol designed to improve the performance and efficiency of web communication. It replaces the older HTTP/1.1 protocol and introduces features like header compression and enhanced request cancellation mechanisms, which collectively enhance the speed and responsiveness of websites.\n\nThis request cancellation mechanism allows clients to terminate unnecessary or redundant requests without waiting for a server's response, reducing network congestion and further improving the overall responsiveness of web applications.\n\nHTTP/2 resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload. The stream ID is essential in clearly associating specific bytes on the network with their corresponding messages, facilitating secure multiplexing and concurrent processing. These streams are bidirectional, enabling clients to transmit frames, and servers to respond with frames using the same ID.\n\nAs detailed in [this technical analysis](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/), there's a vulnerability in the way request cancellation is implemented. The flaw lies in the process of sending an excessive number of requests (specifically, `HEADERS` frames), each immediately followed by a request cancellation frame utilizing the `RST_STREAM` frame. This sequence rapidly leads to a substantial consumption of server-side resources. Consequently, this vulnerability amplifies the risk of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, making it easier to overwhelm and exhaust the server's available resources.\n\nA lot of server applications are vulnerable to the Http/2 Rapid Reset attack.\nHowever, note that HTTP/2 must be enabled, which is not the default configuration on most applications (excluding nghttp2 for example).\nA non-exhaustive list of these vulnerable web applications:\n```\n- Tomcat\n- Jetty\n- NGINX on certain conditions\n- nghttp2\n- Netty\n```",

Closing the connection.\\n\");\n            // You can call nghttp2_submit_goaway() to send a GOAWAY frame if needed.\n            // nghttp2_submit_goaway(session, NGHTTP2_FLAG_NONE, error_code, opaque_data);\n            // Then, close the connection.\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Continue processing other frames if needed\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialize nghttp2_session and set up the on_frame_recv_callback\n    nghttp2_session* session;\n    int rst_stream_counter = 0;\n    \n    // Initialize nghttp2_session, set up callbacks, etc.\n    // ...\n\n    // Set the user data to be passed to the callback\n    nghttp2_session_user_data(session, \u0026rst_stream_counter);\n    \n    // Register the on_frame_recv_callback\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks* callbacks;\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks_new(\u0026callbacks);\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks_set_on_frame_recv_callback(callbacks, on_frame_recv_callback);\n    // Other callback registrations here...\n    \n    // Attach the callbacks to the session\n    nghttp2_session_server_new(\u0026session, callbacks, \u0026rst_stream_counter);\n    \n    // Start processing HTTP/2 frames\n    // ...\n\n    // Cleanup and finish the program\n    // ...\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Golang:\n\nThe default stream concurrency limit in `golang` is `250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection`. This value may be adjusted in the `golang.org/x/net/http2` package using the `Server.MaxConcurrentStreams` setting and the `ConfigureServer` function which are available in `golang.org/x/net/http2`.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/net/http2\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Create an HTTP/2 server instance\n\thttp2Server := \u0026http2.Server{}\n\n\t// Set the desired stream concurrency limit\n\tmaxConcurrentStreams := 500 // Change this to your desired limit\n\thttp2Server.MaxConcurrentStreams = uint32(maxConcurrentStreams)\n\n\t// Configure an HTTP server to use HTTP/2 with the adjusted settings\n\tserver := \u0026http.Server{\n\t\tAddr:    \":8080\",\n\t\tHandler: http.HandlerFunc(handleRequest),\n\t}\n\thttp2.ConfigureServer(server, http2Server)\n\n\t// Start the HTTP server\n\terr := server.ListenAndServeTLS(\"cert.pem\", \"key.pem\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor netty:\n```java\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameListener;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameStream;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2ResetFrame;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2HeadersFrame;\n\npublic class CustomHttp2FrameListener implements Http2FrameListener {\n    private int rstFrameCount = 0;\n    private int maxRstFrameCount = 10; // Adjust this to your desired limit\n    private long resetTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    private long resetTimeIntervalMillis = 60000; // 60 seconds\n\n    @Override\n    public int onDataRead(Http2FrameStream stream, byte[] data, int padding, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle data frames if needed\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onRstStreamRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2ResetFrame resetFrame) {\n        long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n        \n        // Check if the reset time interval has passed, and reset the count if needed\n        if (currentTimeMillis - resetTimeMillis \u003e= resetTimeIntervalMillis) {\n            rstFrameCount = 0;\n            resetTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis;\n        }\n        \n        rstFrameCount++;\n        \n        // Check if the count exceeds the limit\n        if (rstFrameCount \u003e maxRstFrameCount) {\n            // Take action, e.g., close the connection, log, or drop frames\n            // You can use stream or resetFrame to get more context if needed.\n            // To close the connection, you can use stream.connection().close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection.

Golang compiler accepts compiler directives as comments (using `//` single line and `/*` multi-line comments). \n\nA [line directive](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-Compiler_Directives) specifies the source position for the character immediately following the comment as having come from the specified file. The following example specifies that the filename is foo.go and the line number is 10 for the next line in the source code.\n\n`//line foo.go:10` \n\nThe `cgo` package lets Go packages call C code and combines c files and go files into a single Go package. The cgo directives are used to provide flags for the compiler and linker when building the C parts of the package. For security reasons (may lead to code execution), the Golang command restricts the use of `cgo` directives (`//go:cgo_`) unless the file is generated by cgo.\n\nThe Golang compiler has a design problem in the implementation of the `isCgoGeneratedFile()` function, which leads to cgo directives restrictions being bypassed when handling crafted line directives followed by cgo directives. This function's purpose is to determine whether a file was generated by cgo or not, tricking this function is the key to bypassing the compiler restrictions. The following combination tricks the compiler into handling cgo directives as it is part of cgo-generated code (`_cgo_` prefix) although it is not.\n\n```\n//line /tmp/_cgo_.go:1\n//go:cgo_dynamic_linker \"/elf/interp\"\n```\n\nUsing the directives above tricks the compiler to use restricted cgo directives, which can lead to arbitrary code execution when running the `go build` command on the manipulated source code.\n\nThe line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which can make exploiting this issue more complex (may require per-target research).\n\nThe official fix solves this issue by correcting the implementation of the `isCgoGeneratedFile()` function to find the real position of a statement (not the position specified by the line directive).",

The reverse proxy allows bare `LF` characters and doesn't interpret them as line terminators.\n\n2. The backend server allows bare `LF` characters and interprets them as line terminators.\n\nWith the above configuration, HTTP requests reach the backend server, where they are split due to the interpretation of the bare LF as a line terminator. Thus, the smuggled request is processed as an additional individual request.\n\nFor the backend server, there are such servers, for example, `Nginx` or anything that uses Go's `net/http`,  which is unpatched to this vuln (after this patch, Go's `net/http` completely rejects bare LF).\n\nHowever, for reverse proxy, there is no such known proxy (including `Nginx`, `Traefik`). Most known proxies either disallow Bare LF or treat it as a line terminator.\n\nHTTP Request Smuggling is a web security vulnerability where conflicting interpretations of HTTP specifications by different front-end and back-end servers can lead to request manipulation by attackers.\nThis type of attack can lead to the following impacts: DoS, SSRF, XXS, data leakage, cache poisoning, session manipulation, security bypass, and business logic abuse.",
