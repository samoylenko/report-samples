Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens.\n\n### Fix\n\nWe have back-ported the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience).

It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent.\n\n### Details\n\nAn attacker can easily flood the peer address and port for requests.  \n\n### PoC\n\nApply the attached patch to the example and run the client multiple times.  Observe how each request will create a unique histogram and how the memory consumption increases during it.\n### Impact\n\nIn order to be affected, the program has to configure a metrics pipeline, use  [UnaryServerInterceptor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/9d4eb7e7706038b07d33f83f76afbe13f53d171d/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc/interceptor.go#L327), and does not filter any client IP address and ports via middleware or proxies, etc.\n\n### Others\n\nIt is similar to already reported vulnerabilities.\n\n* [GHSA-rcjv-mgp8-qvmr](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-rcjv-mgp8-qvmr) ([open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib))\n- [GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh \"GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh\") ([open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib))\n- [GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p \"GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p\") ([prometheus/client_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang))\n\n### Workaround for affected versions\n\nAs a workaround to stop being affected, a view removing the attributes can be used.\n\nThe other possibility is to disable grpc metrics instrumentation by passing [`otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc/v0.45.0/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc/config.go#L138) option with [`noop.NewMeterProvider`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop#NewMeterProvider).\n\n### Solution provided by upgrading\n\nIn PR [#4322](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/pull/4322), to be released with v0.46.0, the attributes were removed.\n\n### References\n\n- [#4322](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/pull/4322)\n\n|                |                                                                                               |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:golang/go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation@0.35.0#google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc |\n| Affected range | <0.46.0                                                                                       |\n| Fixed version  | 0.46.0                                                                                        |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                           7.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H                                                  |\n"
