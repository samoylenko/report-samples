Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.",

Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\"\ncurve encoding.\n\nThe affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),\nand various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.\n\nApplications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,\nthat make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero\nconstant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a\nresult of reading or writing outside of array bounds.

When this mode is set, the client (or server, depending on the context) will check the validity of the presented certificate against a criteria set.\n\nRaw public keys (RPK) are a cryptographic method in public key infrastructure (PKI) that represent a public key without a digital certificate. Unlike certificates, which include extra details like identity and expiration, raw public keys are simpler and more efficient, making them ideal for resource-limited environments.\n\nIn OpenSSL, connections made using TLS and DTLS with RPKs may allow attackers to man-in-the-middle if clients fail to recognize a failure in server authentication. The problem only emerges when TLS clients deliberately activate RPK usage for the server, which in turn chooses to transmit an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The clients that are impacted are those that expect the handshake to fail if the server’s RPK does not align with one of the anticipated public keys, as determined by setting the verification mode to `SSL_VERIFY_PEER`.\n\nClients that enable server-side RPKs can still find out that RPK verification failed by calling the `SSL_get_verify_result()` function. If this check is made right after the handshake, clients can abort the communication in the proper cases and therefore will not be vulnerable.\n\nNote: By default, RPKs are turned off in both TLS clients and servers.",

It combines the XEX construction and the Tweakable Block Cipher concept to provide confidentiality and data integrity.\n\nA bug was identified in the OpenSSL decryption implementation of the AES-XTS cipher for 64-bit ARM systems, which, when triggered, could result in a crash due to reading beyond the input buffer if the overflow memory is not mapped.\n\nThe ciphertext length must be `4 modulu 5`, meaning a size that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5.\nFor example: 154 bytes, 1024 bytes.\n\nThis issue only affects 64-bit ARM systems (`aarch64`).",

          "full_description": "[The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) is a fundamental protocol of the World Wide Web, enabling the exchange of data between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. It defines the rules for requesting and transmitting web pages and other resources over the internet. Request and response messages are exchanged as a stream of ASCII characters, sent over a reliable transport layer like TCP.\n\n[HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) is a modern network protocol designed to improve the performance and efficiency of web communication. It replaces the older HTTP/1.1 protocol and introduces features like header compression and enhanced request cancellation mechanisms, which collectively enhance the speed and responsiveness of websites.\n\nThis request cancellation mechanism allows clients to terminate unnecessary or redundant requests without waiting for a server's response, reducing network congestion and further improving the overall responsiveness of web applications.\n\nHTTP/2 resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload. The stream ID is essential in clearly associating specific bytes on the network with their corresponding messages, facilitating secure multiplexing and concurrent processing. These streams are bidirectional, enabling clients to transmit frames, and servers to respond with frames using the same ID.\n\nAs detailed in [this technical analysis](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/), there's a vulnerability in the way request cancellation is implemented. The flaw lies in the process of sending an excessive number of requests (specifically, `HEADERS` frames), each immediately followed by a request cancellation frame utilizing the `RST_STREAM` frame. This sequence rapidly leads to a substantial consumption of server-side resources. Consequently, this vulnerability amplifies the risk of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, making it easier to overwhelm and exhaust the server's available resources.\n\nA lot of server applications are vulnerable to the Http/2 Rapid Reset attack.\nHowever, note that HTTP/2 must be enabled, which is not the default configuration on most applications (excluding nghttp2 for example).\nA non-exhaustive list of these vulnerable web applications:\n```\n- Tomcat\n- Jetty\n- NGINX on certain conditions\n- nghttp2\n- Netty\n```",

          "remediation": "##### Deployment mitigations\n\nA possible mitigation is to limit the maximum number of requests that can be made over a single keep-alive connection.\n\n##### Deployment mitigations\n\nFor NGINX:\n\nDisabling HTTP/2 in NGINX is not necessary. Simply ensure you have configured:\n\n- `keepalive_requests` should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests\n- `http2_max_concurrent_streams` should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams\n- `limit_conn` and `limit_req` should be set \"with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security\"\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Nghttp2:\nImplement `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback` callback function, and check and count `RST_STREAM` frames. If an excessive number of `RST_STREAM` frames are received, then take action, such as dropping the connection silently, or calling `nghttp2_submit_goaway` and gracefully terminate the connection.\n```c\n#include \u003cnghttp2/nghttp2.h\u003e\n\n// Callback function for handling frame reception\nint on_frame_recv_callback(nghttp2_session* session,\n                           const nghttp2_frame* frame, void* user_data) {\n    // Check if the received frame is an RST_STREAM frame\n    if (frame-\u003ehd.type == NGHTTP2_RST_STREAM) {\n        // Increment a counter for RST_STREAM frames\n        int* rst_stream_counter = (int*)user_data;\n        (*rst_stream_counter)++;\n        \n        // Define a threshold for excessive RST_STREAM frames\n        int rst_stream_threshold = 10;  // Adjust this value as needed\n        \n        // If the threshold is exceeded, take action (e.g., close the connection)\n        if (*rst_stream_counter \u003e rst_stream_threshold) {\n            // Here, you can choose to close the connection gracefully or drop it\n            // For demonstration purposes, we'll just print a message\n            printf(\"Excessive RST_STREAM frames received. Closing the connection.\\n\");\n            // You can call nghttp2_submit_goaway() to send a GOAWAY frame if needed.\n            // nghttp2_submit_goaway(session, NGHTTP2_FLAG_NONE, error_code, opaque_data);\n            // Then, close the connection.\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Continue processing other frames if needed\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialize nghttp2_session and set up the on_frame_recv_callback\n    nghttp2_session* session;\n    int rst_stream_counter = 0;\n    \n    // Initialize nghttp2_session, set up callbacks, etc.\n    // ...\n\n    // Set the user data to be passed to the callback\n    nghttp2_session_user_data(session, \u0026rst_stream_counter);\n    \n    // Register the on_frame_recv_callback\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks* callbacks;\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks_new(\u0026callbacks);\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks_set_on_frame_recv_callback(callbacks, on_frame_recv_callback);\n    // Other callback registrations here...\n    \n    // Attach the callbacks to the session\n    nghttp2_session_server_new(\u0026session, callbacks, \u0026rst_stream_counter);\n    \n    // Start processing HTTP/2 frames\n    // ...\n\n    // Cleanup and finish the program\n    // ...\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Golang:\n\nThe default stream concurrency limit in `golang` is `250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection`. This value may be adjusted in the `golang.org/x/net/http2` package using the `Server.MaxConcurrentStreams` setting and the `ConfigureServer` function which are available in `golang.org/x/net/http2`.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/net/http2\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Create an HTTP/2 server instance\n\thttp2Server := \u0026http2.Server{}\n\n\t// Set the desired stream concurrency limit\n\tmaxConcurrentStreams := 500 // Change this to your desired limit\n\thttp2Server.MaxConcurrentStreams = uint32(maxConcurrentStreams)\n\n\t// Configure an HTTP server to use HTTP/2 with the adjusted settings\n\tserver := \u0026http.Server{\n\t\tAddr:    \":8080\",\n\t\tHandler: http.HandlerFunc(handleRequest),\n\t}\n\thttp2.ConfigureServer(server, http2Server)\n\n\t// Start the HTTP server\n\terr := server.ListenAndServeTLS(\"cert.pem\", \"key.pem\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor netty:\n```java\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameListener;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameStream;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2ResetFrame;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2HeadersFrame;\n\npublic class CustomHttp2FrameListener implements Http2FrameListener {\n    private int rstFrameCount = 0;\n    private int maxRstFrameCount = 10; // Adjust this to your desired limit\n    private long resetTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    private long resetTimeIntervalMillis = 60000; // 60 seconds\n\n    @Override\n    public int onDataRead(Http2FrameStream stream, byte[] data, int padding, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle data frames if needed\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onRstStreamRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2ResetFrame resetFrame) {\n        long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n        \n        // Check if the reset time interval has passed, and reset the count if needed\n        if (currentTimeMillis - resetTimeMillis \u003e= resetTimeIntervalMillis) {\n            rstFrameCount = 0;\n            resetTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis;\n        }\n        \n        rstFrameCount++;\n        \n        // Check if the count exceeds the limit\n        if (rstFrameCount \u003e maxRstFrameCount) {\n            // Take action, e.g., close the connection, log, or drop frames\n            // You can use stream or resetFrame to get more context if needed.\n            // To close the connection, you can use stream.connection().close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state.

A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is actually used to authenticate.\n\nHowever, it has been discovered that some applications might misuse this API and assume that the last key passed to this function is actually the key used in the authentication process. This assumption may be wrong, due to the caching behavior of the package. Vulnerable applications might later rely on this wrong assumption and make authorization decisions based on this key. An attacker may utilize this for user confusion, essentially bypassing authorization.\n\nApplications are only vulnerable if they rely on the last key passed to `PublicKeyCallback` and make authentication decisions based on it. For example:\n```\nfunc runServer(conn net.Conn) error {\n\tvar pubkey string\n\n\tconfig := ssh.ServerConfig{\n\t\tPublicKeyCallback: func(conn ssh.ConnMetadata, key ssh.PublicKey) (*ssh.Permissions, error) {\n\t\t\tpubkey = ssh.FingerprintSHA256(key)\n\t\t\treturn \u0026ssh.Permissions{}, nil\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\n\tserverConn, chans, reqs, err := ssh.NewServerConn(conn, config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\t// now make decisions based on pubkey\n}\n```\n\nThe patch provided for this issue made it so the assumed property of `PublicKeyCallback` actually holds, and the last key passed to it is the key used to authenticate. However, the client may still not control the last key passed to `PublicKeyCallback` if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as `PasswordCallback`, `KeyboardInteractiveCallback`, or `NoClientAuth`.",

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

          "full_description": "SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that provides a secure way to access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network. [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) refers to an open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, offering encrypted communication for secure access to remote systems over networks.\n\n[AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures secure and efficient encryption and decryption of data.\n\nThe Terrapin attack is a novel cryptographic attack in the SSH protocol itself, causing the compromised client to erroneously perceive that the server lacks support for recent signature algorithms used in user authentication, through a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. It affects a wide range of implementations, including but not limited to OpenSSH, Paramiko, and others. \n\nThere are two vulnerable SSH configurations:\n1. `ChaCha20-Poly1305`\n2. Any `aes(128|192|256)-cbc` ciphers using the default MACs (or any MAC that uses Encrypt-then-MAC, EtM, for example - `hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`).\n\nThe default OpenSSH client and server are vulnerable to this attack, as they are configured to allow the vulnerable `ChaCha20-Poly1305` cipher. \n\nNote that updating either the server or client is not enough! Both must be patched. A vulnerable client connecting to a fixed server will still result in a vulnerable connection.\n\nIn OpenSSH 9.5, a new feature involving [keystroke timing obfuscation](https://lwn.net/Articles/298833/) was introduced. This attack enables a MitM attacker to disable this feature, and consequently to perform a keystroke timing attack against OpenSSH.\n\nThe researchers describe the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher integration as easier to exploit than the aes-cbc EtM. \n\nIn this scenario, a prefix truncation attack is employed, wherein the attacker manipulates sequence numbers to selectively delete chosen packets from the start of a communication channel, compromising channel integrity without detection. Specifically, the attacker can omit the `EXT_INFO` message, crucial for negotiating various protocol extensions (specific signature algorithms) without detection by the client or server. To evade detection, the attacker introduces an ignored packet during the handshake, ensuring the sequence numbers remain aligned.",

However, if side B is slow at sending its own `SSH_MSG_KEXINIT` packet and quick at sending the data packets, or side B is a malicious user that purposefully refrains from sending the `SSH_MSG_KEXINIT` packet, the data packets could drain side A's memory and potentially cause denial of service from resource consumption.",

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.",

These frames include frame type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload.\n\nThe `HEADERS` frame type allows sending HTTP headers of, both, request and response. The `HEADERS` frame contains many flags.\nThe `CONTINUATION` frame type is similar to the `HEADER` frame, but it has just one flag: `END_HEADERS`. When it is not set, the peer knows that more headers are coming in the following `CONTINUATION` frames.\n\nThis mechanism allows an attacker to send an `HTTP/2` stream with `CONTINUATION` frames, without setting the `END_HEADERS` flag in any of the frames. This can cause denial-of-service when sending an excessive number of these crafted frames due to caching all frames in memory.\n\nThough the `net/http` package uses HTTP/2 by default, a Golang web server must have HTTPS configured to be vulnerable to exploitation.\nThe `x/net/http2` package is vulnerable by default.",

        "summary": "Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.",

The issue was fixed by rejecting parse trees which consume more than 256MB of memory.\n\nWhile the `regexp/syntax` package by itself is not that popular, however, the vulnerable function `syntax.Parse` is used by multiple functions from the much more popular `regexp` package.\n\nAttackers can trigger the vulnerability by giving a large or complicated regexp to one of the following API functions:\n\nFrom `regexp/syntax`:\n\n1. `Parse`\n\nFrom `regexp`:\n\n1. `Match`\n2. `MatchReader`\n3. `MatchString`\n4. `Regexp.Compile`\n5. `Regexp.CompilePOSIX`\n6. `Regexp.MustCompile`\n7. `Regexp.MustCompilePOSIX`",

          "full_description": "Golang's [net/http/httputil](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil) package provides HTTP utility functions, complementing the ones in Golang's net/http package.\n\nGolang's [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) package provides HTTP client and server implementations in Golang.\n\nGolang's [net/url](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url) package is used for parsing URLs and query escaping.\n\nIn Go 1.17, URL parsing was changed to reject keys containing a semicolon. But despite the function `net/url.ParseQuery` being changed to raise an error when given a parameter with `;`, the function `net/url.URL.Query`, which calls the `net/url.ParseQuery`, ignores any error returned by it. Furthermore, the function `net/http/httputils.NewSingleHostReverseProxy` does not parse the query at all and sends the raw query to the backend.\n\nThis means that when there's a version discrepancy between the frontend and the backend - where the frontend uses a Go 1.17 or later, and the backend uses Go 1.16.x or earlier - it is possible for attackers to use parameter smuggling in order to bypass possible filters.\n\nTake for example the fictional website `https://mysite`, which uses Go 1.18 for its frontend and Go 1.16 for its backend. When going to `https://mysite/home`, the user's name is added as a parameter, e.g.  `https://mysite/home?name=sam`. In addition to the `name` parameter, it is possible to add a `role` parameter, which can be set to either `user` or `admin`. When the parameter is set to `admin` the frontend checks whether the user's name is that of an admin or not before forwarding the query to the backend.\n\nHowever,  when an attacker sends a request such as `https://mysite/home?role=admin;\u0026name=regularuser`, and the frontend parses it using `net/url.URL.Query`, the function will only return the `name=regularuser` parameter and raise no error. Since the frontend deems the request valid, it will pass it to the backend using `net/http/httputils.NewSingleHostReverseProxy`, which will pass the raw query instead of the parsed query from `net/url.URL.Query` to the backend. When the backend parses the query, both `name=regularuser` and `role=admin` will be returned. Thus, the attacker bypassed the frontend's filter.\n\nThe vulnerability does not exist if the frontend and the backend both use Go before 1.17 or Go after 1.17.",

Golang compiler accepts compiler directives as comments (using `//` single line and `/*` multi-line comments). \n\nA [line directive](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-Compiler_Directives) specifies the source position for the character immediately following the comment as having come from the specified file. The following example specifies that the filename is foo.go and the line number is 10 for the next line in the source code.\n\n`//line foo.go:10` \n\nThe `cgo` package lets Go packages call C code and combines c files and go files into a single Go package. The cgo directives are used to provide flags for the compiler and linker when building the C parts of the package. For security reasons (may lead to code execution), the Golang command restricts the use of `cgo` directives (`//go:cgo_`) unless the file is generated by cgo.\n\nThe Golang compiler has a design problem in the implementation of the `isCgoGeneratedFile()` function, which leads to cgo directives restrictions being bypassed when handling crafted line directives followed by cgo directives. This function's purpose is to determine whether a file was generated by cgo or not, tricking this function is the key to bypassing the compiler restrictions. The following combination tricks the compiler into handling cgo directives as it is part of cgo-generated code (`_cgo_` prefix) although it is not.\n\n```\n//line /tmp/_cgo_.go:1\n//go:cgo_dynamic_linker \"/elf/interp\"\n```\n\nUsing the directives above tricks the compiler to use restricted cgo directives, which can lead to arbitrary code execution when running the `go build` command on the manipulated source code.\n\nThe line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which can make exploiting this issue more complex (may require per-target research).\n\nThe official fix solves this issue by correcting the implementation of the `isCgoGeneratedFile()` function to find the real position of a statement (not the position specified by the line directive).",

The reverse proxy allows bare `LF` characters and doesn't interpret them as line terminators.\n\n2. The backend server allows bare `LF` characters and interprets them as line terminators.\n\nWith the above configuration, HTTP requests reach the backend server, where they are split due to the interpretation of the bare LF as a line terminator. Thus, the smuggled request is processed as an additional individual request.\n\nFor the backend server, there are such servers, for example, `Nginx` or anything that uses Go's `net/http`,  which is unpatched to this vuln (after this patch, Go's `net/http` completely rejects bare LF).\n\nHowever, for reverse proxy, there is no such known proxy (including `Nginx`, `Traefik`). Most known proxies either disallow Bare LF or treat it as a line terminator.\n\nHTTP Request Smuggling is a web security vulnerability where conflicting interpretations of HTTP specifications by different front-end and back-end servers can lead to request manipulation by attackers.\nThis type of attack can lead to the following impacts: DoS, SSRF, XXS, data leakage, cache poisoning, session manipulation, security bypass, and business logic abuse.",

As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21.

For instance, a header with a large number of newline characters may cause the function to over-allocate memory, resulting in memory exhaustion and a denial of service. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by crafting small requests, making it a relatively easy target for malicious activity.\n\nThis issue is dangerous since even a very simple Go HTTP server is remotely vulnerable to DoS.\n\nVulnerable code example -\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc hello(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n    fmt.Fprintf(w, \"hello\\n\")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    http.HandleFunc(\"/hello\", hello)\n    http.ListenAndServe(\":80\", nil)\n}\n```",

        "summary": "A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary ...",

        "summary": "A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",
