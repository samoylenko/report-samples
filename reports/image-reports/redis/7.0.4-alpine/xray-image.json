          "full_description": "OpenSSL is an open-source cryptographic library and toolset that provides a wide range of protocol supported and functions for secure communication, data encryption, digital certificates, and other cryptographic operations, widely used in various software applications and systems.\nIn OpenSSL, the `SSL_VERIFY_PEER` verification mode is used to enforce the verification of the remote server's SSL/TLS certificate during the handshake process of a secure connection. When this mode is set, the client (or server, depending on the context) will check the validity of the presented certificate against a criteria set.\n\nRaw public keys (RPK) are a cryptographic method in public key infrastructure (PKI) that represent a public key without a digital certificate. Unlike certificates, which include extra details like identity and expiration, raw public keys are simpler and more efficient, making them ideal for resource-limited environments.\n\nIn OpenSSL, connections made using TLS and DTLS with RPKs may allow attackers to man-in-the-middle if clients fail to recognize a failure in server authentication. The problem only emerges when TLS clients deliberately activate RPK usage for the server, which in turn chooses to transmit an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The clients that are impacted are those that expect the handshake to fail if the server’s RPK does not align with one of the anticipated public keys, as determined by setting the verification mode to `SSL_VERIFY_PEER`.\n\nClients that enable server-side RPKs can still find out that RPK verification failed by calling the `SSL_get_verify_result()` function. If this check is made right after the handshake, clients can abort the communication in the proper cases and therefore will not be vulnerable.\n\nNote: By default, RPKs are turned off in both TLS clients and servers.",

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are...",

This can be used for a known-plaintext attack, where an adversary possesses both the plaintext and its corresponding encrypted form, aiming to deduce the encryption key or gain insights into the encryption algorithm.\n\nTo counter this, we use an Initialization vector (IV), which is a random or unique input to a cryptographic algorithm used to alter the first block of the cipher, ensuring equal plaintext blocks won’t be transformed to equal ciphertexts.\n\nA vulnerability was found in OpenSSL 3.x, in certain situations, parameters such as key length or IV length, will be processed after the key and IV have been established, hence they will not take effect as intended, potentially causing truncation or overreading of these values, impacting the confidentiality of the encryption.\n\nWhen calling the functions `EVP_CipherInit_ex2`, `EVP_EncryptInit_ex2, or `EVP_DecryptInit_ex2` with an `OSSL_PARAM` array, changes to the `keylen` or `ivlen` parameters will only be processed after the IV and the key have been established.\n\nNote this impacts the following ciphers: RC2, RC4, RC5, and the following cipher modes: CCM, GCM, OCB.",

It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.\n\nIt was discovered that when an X.509 certificate contains a bad policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, the write lock is acquired recursively twice.\nOn Windows, this results in a deadlock and a denial of service when the affected process hangs.\n\nThe issue results due to the `ossl_policy_cache_set_mapping()` obtaining the X.509 lock a second time before the `ossl_policy_cache_set()` function releases it.\n\nOn Linux using `pthreads` - the second attempt to obtain the lock simply fails without any security impact.\nOn Windows it seems that attempting to obtain the lock a second time hangs.\n\nTo exploit this issue, Policy Processing must be enabled, which is highly unlikely for a publicly-facing server.\n\nPolicy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling either `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()` or `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` functions.\n\nThis issue only affects the Windows version of OpenSSL 3.x.",

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those\nchecks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use\na very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which\nis over 10,000 bits in length.\n\nHowever the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters\nthat have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value\neven if it has already been found to be too large.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the '-check' option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.",

        "summary": "A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).",

        "summary": "Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation\ncontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running\non PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.\n\nImpact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC\nalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various\napplication dependent consequences.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for\nPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order\nthan they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.",
