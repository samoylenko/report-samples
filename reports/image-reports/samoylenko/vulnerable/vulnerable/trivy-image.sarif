And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.\n\nThis vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available.

However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself\ncan overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,\nwhich is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate\nneatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which\ncontains the same check, copied from the hashtab code.\n\nThe commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this, but the fix\ndid not account for the UB, so the fix only works on CPUs where an\noverflow does result in a neat truncation to zero, which is not\nguaranteed. Checking the value before rounding does not have this\nproblem."

Details are described in each commit log.\n\n\nThis patch (of 3):\n\nA use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on\nthe nilfs_sc_info structure.\n\nThe problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log\nwriter thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure\nis about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime.\n\nFix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer\nthread is alive."

Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\n\n\tif (!hidpp-\u003eprotocol_major) {\n\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\n\t\thidpp-\u003eprotocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n\t}\n\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003ename == hdev-\u003ename) {\n\t\t...\n\t\thidpp-\u003ename = new_name;\n\t}\n\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\n\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\n        if (hidpp-\u003ebattery.ps)\n                return 0;\n\n\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n}\n\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003edelayed_input)\n\t\treturn;\n\n\thidpp-\u003edelayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\n\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\n   devm_kmemdup()\n\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\n   hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\n   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\n   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties which\n   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\n\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---"

But, the async_write\nflag is now used as a marker by commit 7f42ec394156 (\"nilfs2: fix issue\nwith race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks\") as\na means of resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks in\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and the\nresulting crash.\n\nThis modification is safe as long as it is used for file data and b-tree\nnode blocks where the page caches are independent.  However, it was\nirrelevant and redundant to also introduce async_write for segment summary\nand super root blocks that share buffers with the backing device.

And that in turn fixes the module\nunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference\nuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the\nlast reference to the KVM module.\n\nNote that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off\nthe completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the\nwork will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting\non the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the\nwork to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very\nsmall delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a\nnew request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the\nremaining work is really just:\n\n        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);\n\n        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);\n\n        mmput(mm);\n\nand mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is\nstill alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.\n\nAdd a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with \"wakeup all\"\nwork items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a\nworkqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes\n__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).\n\nNote, commit 5f6de5cbebee (\"KVM: Prevent module exit until al\n---truncated---"

When the NTB is parsed, unwrap call looks for\nany leftover bytes in SKB provided by u_ether and if there are any pending\nbytes, it treats them as a separate NTB and parses it.

In this case, the USB transfer must still\nbe shorter than dwNtbInMaxSize or dwNtbOutMaxSize. If\nexactly dwNtbInMaxSize or dwNtbOutMaxSize bytes are sent,\nand the size is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize for the\ngiven pipe, then no ZLP shall be sent.\n\nwBlockLength= 0x0000 must be used with extreme care, because\nof the possibility that the host and device may get out of\nsync, and because of test issues.\n\nwBlockLength = 0x0000 allows the sender to reduce latency by\nstarting to send a very large NTB, and then shortening it when\nthe sender discovers that there’s not sufficient data to justify\nsending a large NTB\"\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue with the current implementation,\nas it checks for the occurrence of multiple NTBs in a single\ngiveback by verifying if the leftover bytes to be processed is zero\nor not. If the block length reads zero, we would process the same\nNTB infintely because the leftover bytes is never zero and it leads\nto a crash. Fix this by bailing out if block length reads zero."

We'll have to fail fork()-\u003etrack_pfn_copy() if\nthe first page was replaced by an anon folio, though: we'd have to store\nthe cachemode in the VMA to make this work, likely growing the VMA size.\n\nFor now, lets keep it simple and let track_pfn_copy() just fail in that\ncase: it would have failed in the past with swap/nonswap entries already,\nand it would have done the wrong thing with anon folios.\n\nSimple reproducer to trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE() in untrack_pfn():\n\n\u003c--- C reproducer ---\u003e\n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e\n #include \u003csys/mman.h\u003e\n #include \u003cunistd.h\u003e\n #include \u003cliburing.h\u003e\n\n int main(void)\n {\n         struct io_uring_params p = {};\n         int ring_fd;\n         size_t size;\n         char *map;\n\n         ring_fd = io_uring_setup(1, \u0026p);\n         if (ring_fd \u003c 0) {\n                 perror(\"io_uring_setup\");\n                 return 1;\n         }\n         size = p.sq_off.array + p.sq_entries * sizeof(unsigned);\n\n         /* Map the submission queue ring MAP_PRIVATE */\n         map = mmap(0, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE,\n                    ring_fd, IORING_OFF_SQ_RING);\n         if (map == MAP_FAILED) {\n                 perror(\"mmap\");\n                 return 1;\n         }\n\n         /* We have at least one page.

On the other hand,\ncreate_flow_handle tries hard to find and reference already existing\nidentical rules instead of creating new ones.\n\nThese two behaviors can result in a situation where create_flow_handle\n1) creates a new rule and references it, then\n2) in a subsequent step during the same handle creation references it\n   again,\nresulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into the\ntree, will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash when\nthe flow group is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on rule\ndeletion, assumes node-\u003eparent is != NULL.\n\nThis happened in the wild, due to another bug related to incorrect\nhandling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead to the code in\ncreate_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule in the same\nflow handle, resulting in the problem described above. Full details are\nat [1].\n\nThis patch changes add_rule_fg to add new rules without parents into\nthe tree, properly initializing them and avoiding the crash.

As the inner\nprotocol can be Ethernet, NSH GSO handler, nsh_gso_segment(), calls\nskb_mac_gso_segment() to invoke inner protocol GSO handlers.\n\nnsh_gso_segment() does the following for the original skb before\ncalling skb_mac_gso_segment()\n\n  1. reset skb-\u003enetwork_header\n  2. save the original skb-\u003e{mac_heaeder,mac_len} in a local variable\n  3. pull the NSH header\n  4. resets skb-\u003emac_header\n  5. set up skb-\u003emac_len and skb-\u003eprotocol for the inner protocol.\n\nand does the following for the segmented skb\n\n  6. set ntohs(ETH_P_NSH) to skb-\u003eprotocol\n  7. push the NSH header\n  8. restore skb-\u003emac_header\n  9. set skb-\u003emac_header + mac_len to skb-\u003enetwork_header\n 10. restore skb-\u003emac_len\n\nThere are two problems in 6-7 and 8-9.\n\n  (a)\n  After 6 \u0026 7, skb-\u003edata points to the NSH header, so the outer header\n  (ETH_P_8021AD in this case) is stripped when skb is sent out of netdev.\n\n  Also, if NSH is encapsulated by NSH + Ethernet (so NSH-Ethernet-NSH),\n  skb_pull() in the first nsh_gso_segment() will make skb-\u003edata point\n  to the middle of the outer NSH or Ethernet header because the Ethernet\n  header is not pulled by the second nsh_gso_segment().\n\n  (b)\n  While restoring skb-\u003e{mac_header,network_header} in 8 \u0026 9,\n  nsh_gso_segment() does not assume that the data in the linear\n  buffer is shifted.\n\n  However, udp6_ufo_fragment() could shift the data and change\n  skb-\u003emac_header accordingly as demonstrated by syzbot.\n\n  If this happens, even the restored skb-\u003emac_header points to\n  the middle of the outer header.\n\nIt seems nsh_gso_segment() has never worked with outer headers so far.\n\nAt the end of nsh_gso_segment(), the outer header must be restored for\nthe segmented skb, instead of the NSH header.\n\nTo do that, let's calculate the outer header position relatively from\nthe inner header and set skb-\u003e{data,mac_header,protocol} properly.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_process_outbound drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:524 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l3 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:602 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_queue_xmit+0xf44/0x16b0 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:668\n ipvlan_process_outbound drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:524 [inline]\n ipvlan_xmit_mode_l3 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:602 [inline]\n ipvlan_queue_xmit+0xf44/0x16b0 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:668\n ipvlan_start_xmit+0x5c/0x1a0 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_main.c:222\n __netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:4989 [inline]\n netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:5003 [inline]\n xmit_one net/core/dev.c:3547 [inline]\n dev_hard_start_xmit+0x244/0xa10 net/core/dev.c:3563\n __dev_queue_xmit+0x33ed/0x51c0 net/core/dev.c:4351\n dev_queue_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:3171 [inline]\n packet_xmit+0x9c/0x6b0 net/packet/af_packet.c:276\n packet_snd net/packet/af_packet.c:3081 [inline]\n packet_sendmsg+0x8aef/0x9f10 net/packet/af_packet.c:3113\n sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline]\n __sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:745 [inline]\n __sys_sendto+0x735/0xa10 net/socket.c:2191\n __do_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2203 [inline]\n __se_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2199 [inline]\n __x64_sys_sendto+0x125/0x1c0 net/socket.c:2199\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xcf/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b\n\nUninit was created at:\n slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:3819 [inline]\n slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:3860 [inline]\n __do_kmalloc_node mm/slub.c:3980 [inline]\n __kmalloc_node_track_caller+0x705/0x1000 mm/slub.c:4001\n kmalloc_reserve+0x249/0x4a0 net/core/skbuff.c:582\n __\n---truncated---"

If the\ncorresponding interrupt is still unmasked, the first bus reset will\nusually freeze the system due to irq_handler being called again each\ntime it exits. This freeze can be reproduced by loading firewire_ohci\nwith \"modprobe firewire_ohci debug=-1\" (to enable all debugging output).\nApparently there are also some cases where bus_reset_work will get called\nsoon enough to clear the event, and operation will continue normally.\n\nThis freeze was first reported a few months after a007bb85 was committed,\nbut until now it was never fixed. The debug level could safely be set\nto -1 through sysfs after the module was loaded, but this would be\nineffectual in logging bus reset interrupts since they were only\nunmasked during initialization.\n\nirq_handler will now leave the event flag set but mask bus reset\ninterrupts, so irq_handler won't be called again and there will be no\nfreeze. If OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS is enabled, bus_reset_work will\nunmask the interrupt after servicing the event, so future interrupts\nwill be caught as desired.\n\nAs a side effect to this change, OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS can now be\nenabled through sysfs in addition to during initial module loading.\nHowever, when enabled through sysfs, logging of bus reset interrupts will\nbe effective only starting with the second bus reset, after\nbus_reset_work has executed."

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.
