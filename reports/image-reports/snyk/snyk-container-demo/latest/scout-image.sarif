[OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)\n",

                "markdown": "> Attackers could trick execa into executing arbitrary binaries. This behaviour is caused by the setting `preferLocal=true` which makes execa search for locally installed binaries and executes them. This vulnerability is usually only exploitable when using execa on a client-side LOCAL application.\n\n|                |                                              |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:npm/execa@0.7.0                          |\n| Affected range | <2.0.0                                       |\n| Fixed version  | 2.0.0                                        |\n| CVSS Score     |                                          9.8 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |\n"
