The issue arises from improper sanitization in `Link` header values, which can allow a combination of characters like `,`, `;`, and `<>` to preload malicious resources.  This vulnerability is especially relevant for dynamic parameters.  Sonatype's research suggests that this CVE's details differ from those defined at NVD.
